hello good people today i'm going to
talk about
five stocks five that i think you should
be looking at this coming
week okay let's dive right into it
uh for those of you that's new to the
page hit the like button hit the
subscribe button in the notification
bell right off the back
i'm going to tell you right now you're
going to want to come back and give your
boy uncle larry a shout out all right
so um i got five stocks i want to talk
to you about that
i think that you should uh be looking at
this week
and i'm not telling you to go ahead and
dump all your money into it
just keep an eye on it do your own
investigating
and you know of course before you make
any financial decisions
you should always do your own research
and
consult with your financial advisor to
which i am not
but i got some info for you guys right
so
the first three are actually an energy
right so one of the things that
one of the only things that i heard from
the presidential debate
that both presidents agreed on is
renewable energy and uh and specifically
charging stations for evs electric
vehicles right
and so there's three main ones that
stick out to me i've there's a bunch of
them
but there's three main ones that you'll
see that's all over youtube and
a lot of people have been talking about
one is
$plug the ticker ticker letters $p-l-u-g
one is $blink ticker symbol $b-l-n-k
and the other one is $switchback energy
right
or some people call it $charge point
because it is a spac and acquisition
and the ticker symbol on it is $s b
e i got allergies i feel the sneeze
coming on all right we're going to keep
going
so i want to start with these three all
right $blink
has about 2 800 charging stations
abroad there's different numbers all
over the place
and there's they're con conflicting but
i will tell you
that $blink is a
company that's worth looking at a lot of
people
are are so so on $blink
but look at what $blink is doing look at
what $blink has done
um and in the last month
uh look at what $blink has done in the
last week especially the last month
and you will say hmm okay it's worth
looking at
and then there's $plug $plug is also an
a company that has a lot of potential
the the problem with
$plug and $blink are these two companies
are struggling to make profits
right and so you keep when you're trying
to build an infrastructure across the
country
you struggle to make profits because
you're always reinvesting right
first of all i want to let you guys know
as you can see i'm not in my studio
right now
i'm i'm doing a little tweaks on some
stuff uh
not facing the way the camera face but
on the other wall
i'm getting some stuff done and so i'm
here in
um i'm here in a theater room today all
right so i'll be back in the studio
all right so i'm just chilling with
y'all today okay
so $switch back or $charge point out of
the three
ev companies i more interested in it
because it's so massive it's worldwide
and you know they got under just under
50 000
um stations worldwide okay 40 you see
some say 23 000 some say 49
000 i just say under 50 000 all three of
these companies are
growing right so getting back to the
presidential debate if that's what you
want to call it
the one thing that both both candidates
agreed on was charging stations and
one of the candidates even said that
there is currently he said that there is
currently under 50 000
and he would like for it to be 500 000.
so there you go you see conflicting
numbers everywhere right
there's just conflicting numbers a lot
of them have
inflated their numbers but we do know
that energy is heading
towards charging stations
an energy company renewable energy and
and cars are heading
towards zero emissions that is now
it's not just the future but it's now so
that's why
i think it's good to have bp
uh and it's good to have amico you know
it's it's good to invest in forward and
it's good to invest in $ge
so those of you that's new don't just
get stuck in
one company and think it's okay it's
good to have
a stock in $lowe's and $home depot
right they're both doing good doing this
doing this
uh corona virus age that we're in right
now they're all they're both doing good
they're all doing good
you know $lumber is up like 33
right so it's a sector that is needed
so what i will tell you guys is i'm
going to tell you right now
they're not short plays these
are long-term investments right you want
to add to your positions over the years
those of you that are just day traders
that's cool
right but understand why you're trading
you're making these quick pops
you need to be doing some long-term
investing and you'll see
you'll do greater on the long-term
investments
than you're doing the short-term
investments so
diversify and do them both right if
if if you play this right you will have
a lot of money over a 10-year period
but if you're just in here for just this
season and you're back out
yeah you know do your thing peace but i
know me
i want to put away for the future right
i'm not going to get into preaching to
y'all like i normally do
right so remember $sbe
right $charge point or $switch back energy
that's number one for me
but i will personally tell you i have
positions in all three that's $sbe
$switch back $blink $blnk
and then uh $plug right i have
positions in all three and yes
all three are green right and i see a
because i see a sea of growth for all of
them just think about this
as evs get more popular and gas engines
starts to decrease what are we gonna
need
we're going to need gas stations and gas
stations now
and are are now charging stations and
those for those of you that bring up
$tesla
$tesla can only charge $teslas
for right now so $tesla is either
going to put a uh a converter on their
charge
charging stations to where it could
charge
other cars like $chargepoint does um
or they're going to start buying out
someone else that already has the
infrastructure
right and there's talk about that you
know with either $blinker $plug
but you know until it happens until the
ink is is dry
it it's all over the place so um just
know that whoever has this space it's
okay to have stock in the first company
and the second company you know the
biggest company
and then the next biggest company and
then the next company after that
because that's what oil did oil if you'd
have gotten oil
when it first became a thing especially
here in the states
you could have picked three companies
and you'd be a billionaire
all right so i'm just bringing that out
to you guys
all right i'm i'm sounding a little
choked up today because these allergies
are
still kicking my butt thank you guys for
all of your suggestions
all right so there's two more that i'm
going to talk about
one is $lca $lancadia yep
old $lancadia you're saying but it's it's
it's tank and it's tanking
it is undervalued guys $lca is
undervalued
let me give you the bad news about $lca
um
the ceo who actually had a show that i
used to watch on cnbc
all right where he would give people
contracts go check it out
just google it um but
he's on both ends of this deal and a lot
of people
are concerned about that including
myself so
he's the blank check company and he's
the the company that's looking to be
merged with the blank check company it's
a spac
right special purpose acquisition
company
and so a lot of people are concerned
about that including myself
but the thing about it is it's already
profitable and it's
what in one state and if they begin to
get licensing
in other states this stock will explode
and uh they're
they'll they they're suffering from lack
of information
there's no new news on it let me say
that again
there's no new news on $lancadia
$lca and that's what it's suffering from
and uh but i think it's a good play um i
think
that once they announce a merger i mean
i think it'll i think it'll hit the the
52-week high
you know just think of you get it where
it is now and hit 20
you've made a nice piece of change i
think $lca is a
is a quick graph for you quick grabbers
it's a quick grab
so i would check it out also right the
last one i'm going to talk to you guys
about and you're going to go
can't this dude get over this stock it's
$hylian
but this week i want you to keep your
eyes on the
$hylian warrants i don't know all the
platforms you can get it on
i do know that you can get it on
fidelity
and you can get it on td ameritrade
right so
look for uh $h-y-l-n-w-s
right or $h-y-l-n plus on td ameritrade
just google it research it you'll find
it
here's why the warrants
were oversold um
they were oversold well it was yeah
oversold
more than the stock itself
and the warrants generally operates in
lockstep
with the stock price at about 50 less
and as you can see right now
it's down more than 50
and what happens is it has a greater uh
movement upwards when when the stock
moves
so there were days and those i'm going
to tell you guys you go oh but
oh you got to exercise the warrants no
i'm talking about just
selling the warrants for face value i
will tell you i got 500 watts
that i'm gonna exercise when that time
comes so i'm good with that position
right
and then i have the stock i got a couple
hundred in the stock
i'm good with that position right but
for a quick play
a quick grab if you look at the 52-week
high on the warrants
you can literally buy the warrants at
face
value and sell them at face value
right and so you you you set your limit
button
i showed you guys how to do that and if
it hits
you could just grab some quick cash and
go
so there's nothing wrong with doing that
i did it before
and here's why i kept i was buying
warrants
by i mean buying this the share buying
highland
shares right i kept buying the shares
and then on day to day
or week to week i would look at the
chart and i would see that
highlighting this the the the stock
would be up like like five percent right
but the wards would be up like 12
so who cares if they're warrants i don't
need to go through exercises and wants
i sold them at face value of course the
warrants
was less than half the price of the
stock shares
so i was able to buy more uh warrants
and i was able to make more money so
instead of putting an extra
thousand dollars into the shares i put
it into the warrants
and popped it twelve percent is more
than eight percent
all day long and especially on a stock
that's cheaper
okay so guys just look at it as face
value sometimes there's ways to make
money right and yes i have five
other 500 other warrants that i can pop
over 500 warrants that i'm going to
exercise
when the time comes i'm going to hold
long all right
i don't want to keep this loan let's
just briefly go over
the five stock i just want you to look
at this week
$switch back $s s b e right
$blink $b l n k $plug
$p l u g $lancadia
$lca and $hylian
warrants $h-y-l-n-w-s
or $h-y-l-n plus or whatever brokerage
you own they might have it under
something else right
so as you guys could see i'm not in my
normal studio
for those of you that are new hit the
subscribe button
hit the notification bell then hit that
like button
and leave me a comment there was one
other thing that i
i'm gonna leave you as a bonus right um
i will tell you guys that i think it's
$plug
i'm not sure but i think it's pluck they
are
under investigation uh from this
weiss llc if you see weiss
llc i'm going to tell you another way to
make some quick money
if you if you see a company that is
under investigation from weiss
llc which is to me an ambulance chasing
a law firm i'm going to do this
i'm going to buy that stock and when it
comes out that is a
big nothing burger which they they they
go after every spec known a man
and when it comes out so the stock falls
after
oh they're under investigation they're
under investigation and then when it
turns out to be a big fat nothing burger
then the stock
runs back up right so i'm going to
look for who's under investigation
from weiss llc and i'm going to invest
that's going to be a little
a little experiment that i'm gonna do
and
um i'm not sure but um tomorrow i'm
gonna set a limit price
uh on $hylian warrants
and i'm just going to see where they're
at
right so what i'm going to do as an
experiment i don't want you guys to do
it
uncle larry is going to do it i'm going
to just
buy 500 worth of the warrants if
i'm going to set a limit price at 13 so
if it drops under 13
13 a share the warrants i'm going to buy
500
worth of the warrants and then let's see
if it runs if it runs this week i might
pop it
and just make a little change just to
prove my thesis
right i like saying that word because it
makes me uh sound like i'm smart
thesis all right you people uh good
people i'm gonna talk to you later
remember hit the like button subscribe
button notification bell we'll see you
next time i might be out here
and i might be back in the studio but
make sure
you guys keep an eye on these five
different stocks peace love you guys
