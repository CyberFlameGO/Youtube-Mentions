hey guys what is going on welcome to the
video so in this video we're gonna be
going over the top five stocks that i'm
looking to buy
and trade for this upcoming week some of
these are longer term swings some of
these are very quick trades we'll be
going through the thesis on each one of
those
and also going through the picks from
last week's how they performed in my
updated thesis on those so without
further ado
let's go ahead and get into it alright
so the first pick from last week was $bed
bath beyond ticker symbol $bby
the thesis on this one was the short
squeeze leading up to earnings and
personally i was also playing this one
through earnings
so taking a look at the technical chart
we can see that we got that breakout
out of the downtrending trend line we
got a huge run running up to earnings
earnings did disappoint though but it
was still up a good amount from the call
out
in the mid 17 from last week's video so
overall winning trade not that overall
outcome that we wanted
but still pretty solid overall next up
$fubotv ticker symbol $fubo
so this is overall slightly down for the
week but we had the perfect buying
opportunity
on monday so on monday this stock dipped
down to 23 and bounced off that support
level so that was a perfect
entry for this swing trade so for this
trade we're looking for a break above 30
dollars in this stock i believe will run
to 34 to 35
so we have not gotten that break yet
we've gotten rejected twice at the 30
level but this the week that assuming
you break that 30 level and my price
target for this trade is 35
by the end of this coming week and if
you don't get it this week i do expect
this to break out the next week
the super hyped up stocks that are
heavily shorted they do not sit down for
long and i expect
$fubo to have a big run very very soon so
next up $overstock ticker symbol $ostk
we called this one out last week at the
bottom of this falling wedge so overall
this stock was up 10
for the week even after a 7 drop on
friday
so taking a look at the technical chart
update we can see where we called this
out last week right at the bottom
of the downtrend channel we got a big
balance and a big run
up to the 60 range we got rejected at 60
and right now we're sitting right at
about 54
per share so this one that we're looking
to trade in and out of every time it
gets to the bottom of the wedge
that's always a buy and if we can break
the top of that wedge that down training
trend line
if we break out of that i believe that
we see a huge breakout coming very very
soon
so watching for that breakout but for
the time being just trading off these
two levels
so next up $salesforce ticker symbol $crm
this is overall
pretty flat for the week now taking a
look at the chart we can see the big
level that we're trying to break with
this one is 230 dollars per share
we have not tested that level again yet
but when we do break above that that's
where i see the run to 240 to 250
so this is more of a longer term swing
waiting patiently for that break of 2 30
which i believe will happen in the next
couple weeks if not this week
and once we break above that 230 level
that's when the breakout will come so
being patient with this trade overall
and finally the last trade for last week
was $workhorse ticker symbol $wkhs
had an absolutely massive run even after
that eight percent drop on friday
this is still up 23 for the week up 31
before the drop on friday and last week
we called this one out right at the 20
support level we had a huge reversal off
that level
we broke above that resistance level
we're looking to break at 23
so once we broke that 23 level like i
said last week once it breaks this level
it's off to the races we got that break
and we went all the way up to the high
of 28 dollars per share and right now
sitting a little bit above 25
per share so overall this is a big
winner for the week as we got that big
breakout we're looking for so there's
the recap for last week's trades
and this week i have some trades that
i'm very very excited about i know you
guys love your penny stocks i threw in
two very low cap stocks that i believe
have massive upside
and not very much a downside and one
with a huge technical pattern
that i believe will see a 2x from this
level which we'll go ahead and get into
in just a second so let's take a look at
that all right so this stock this is the
stock that i'm most excited about
overall for this upcoming week
this is $$ocean power technologies ticker
symbol $opt
so first off we'll take a look at the
technical setup and then we'll go over
why i like this stock so much
so for these technicals we have a
perfect setup for an ascending triangle
i always preach that patterns that form
over a short period of time
most of the times do not play out but
patterns that form over multiple months
these are very likely to play out and
when that breakout does play out
from these setups that's where you get
the big move and these are the stocks
that end up as big winners so taking a
look at this ascending triangle setup
we can see that since september this
ascending triangle has been setting up
it's tested that 350 level twice
has gotten rejected has had to dump off
but has always dropped back and held
this trend line that we're looking at
now never breaking below for more than a
couple days at a time
so $$ocean power technology this has
everything going for right now
it has the blue government which is all
about renewable energy they're going to
be flooding money in
i would not be surprised to see ocean
power technology is getting some funding
from the government
as they're expected to put trillions
into renewable energy they've also
worked with the navy in the past so
that another partnership is not out of
the cards for this trade
and just taking a look at their main
three products and what they do is a lot
about harvesting energy from the waves
using clean efficient lithium batteries
they also have a solar side to the
business
they also have a sub c battery that have
very low self-discharge rates that are
highly efficient control
so a couple potential catalysts that we
have going for it is possibly another
contract with the navy
with the government expected to put
trillions in renewable energy i would
not be surprised one bit if this company
gets a bunch of government funding
there are not many other companies in
the space of $ocean power harvesting
power from the ocean
in a renewable sense so in a way this
company kind of sits by itself
and could be a big focus for investors
if the government was to put a lot of
money towards hydropower
this stock would get a ton of attention
a ton of hype so let's look at an
example of another extending triangle
that happened this past week
for the exact same setup we'll take a
look at that first how it played out and
where i could see this stock going and
my personal price target for $opt
so this past friday $p-o-l-a had the
exact same pattern as $opt has now
had tested that resistance level
multiple times it was forming that
ascending triangle
so we ended up getting that breakout on
friday and an absolutely huge run
and hit a high of eight dollars breaking
out from that 6.50
resistance level in my opinion this is a
perfect example of what $opt has the
capability
to do i also called this stock out on
the discourse if you're interested by
the way
the link is the first link in the
description if you're looking to join
that discord but anyways i see the same
pattern playing out with $opt
and breaking out if it can break above
that 3.50 resistance level
i see this stock having initial pop up
to five dollars
we may get a pullback from there i do
believe that this stock does have five
dollars on the table
and if not it does have more upside than
that if it does break above three dollar
fifty cents
now it could get rejected a couple more
times at 350 but as long as this
ascending triangle
holds as long as it does play out i do
think we get a huge breakout on the way
everything is going for it renewable
energy technical setup you can't go
wrong with this trade in my personal
opinion
and this will be my number one focus for
this week ahead all right so the next
stock i'll be talking about
is another small cap slash penny stock
play so this stock is $merimed ticker
symbol $mrmd
so this is a cannabis stock currently
trading for 58 cents per share
and this is my overall favorite cannabis
stock in the entire market
so this is not much of a trade based on
technicals but we'll look at the setup
in just a second
this is a play based on fundamentals
it's very very undervalued fundamentally
compared to
other cannabis stocks and i do believe
that the market will realize this stock
very soon with cannabis hot right now
with the blue government coming in
we could get more legalization news and
anything like that so i expect the
cannabis sector to stay hot
this is the most undervalued cannabis
stock in my personal opinion has
absolutely massive upside so before we
take a look at the fundamentals and what
products this company has
let's go ahead and take a look at the
technical setup that this stock has so
the stock has been on a very solid
uptrend recently
and it has established a very strong
level at 55 cents per share
so it got rejected initially at 55 cents
it started consolidating for a while
it then broke out at 55 cents we broke
all the way up to 71 cents per share
we tried it down bounced right back over
55 cents this week
and we're holding this level right now
so i believe right now is an absolutely
perfect entry
in the 50s slash low 60s this is where
i'm looking to add more shares and add
more on any red days
so now taking a look at the valuation
and fundamentals of this company
first off this is on their investor
presentation this compares their
fundamentals
compared to other company fundamental in
the exact same space so judging by this
and if they're valued the same as their
peers
this would be four dollars and 48 cents
per share as of right now it's just 60
cents per share
the market cap is just above 200 million
dollars their revenue multiple of 2021
is only 1.5 x which should be a lot more
for a big
growth cannabis company these other
companies such as $cgc
$acb they trade for such a premium
they're debt riddled
$merimet is so much of a healthier
company they have such better assets on
hand and only trading for
3.4 times the ebitda so we can see the
consistent financial growth this company
has had
all the way from 2015 up to 2019 and
also the total assets that they have
as these other companies are debt
riddled like i was saying their assets
are going down
$merimet is going way up their assets are
going up very steadily
and we can take a look at some of the
brands that they own the big one here
is betty's eddies this is one of the
best sellers on many many
cannabis sites that sell and this
company overall has a very strong growth
strategy underhand
they own a couple giant 46 000 square
foot dispensaries
and 2021 is expected to reflect the
revenue from these new areas such as
massachusetts
illinois and also something to keep an
eye on is their quarterly net income
what we saw in september of 2020 we saw
the net income finally turn positive
and this is a huge sign whenever you see
the net income turning positive for a
company like this
for a very beginning stage growth
company that is absolutely huge and the
stock price usually takes a big
pop learning this and i think we have
seen a minimal pop so far and this stock
has a ton more way to go
they also have very consistent very high
gross margins over 60 percent
quarterly revenues with a couple outlier
years quarterly revenues are steadily
increasing
and overall we can see three years ago
this stock was trading for five dollars
and 80 cents
at its highest right now it's below a
dollar so my price target for this stock
is i'm not gonna sell any shares until
this stock
is at least over one dollar and i see
this stock over one dollar and fifty
cents within the next couple months
i would expect by june we see this stock
at one dollar fifty cents plus
so this is not any micro cap play but
this is a very small cap
penny stock that i see being a future
billion dollar company very very
undervalued overall
and this is more of a buy and hold for
me i'm looking at this as a swing trade
while cannabis is hot this coming year i
believe it will stay hot
i see the stock being easily over one
dollar in the next couple months
potentially two to three dollars by the
end of 2021
so i'll probably be looking to trade in
and out of the stock when we see a big
move
but for now i'm waiting for that big
move holding strong adding any dips
and will not be selling anything under
one dollar i'm very rarely confident in
these very low cap stocks
but with this stock i'm very comfortable
holding long term because of these
fundamentals
because of the sector itself and because
of its industry peers
comparative valuations all right so the
next i'm going to be talking about is
$canoe ticker symbol $g-o-e-v
so this stock is currently trading for
15 a share i've talked a lot about this
company in the past but they have some
big things going for them right now
so let's talk about it so this past week
$apple announced that they're gonna be
working on their apple car
with the company $hyundai and who else is
working with cars with $hyundai and
$hyundai uses their technology for some
cars
this is $canoe so taking a look at this
video and just looking at the $canoe
vehicle
in my personal opinion just the look of
the $canoe vehicle the futuristic
minimalistic design
this just reminds me of something that
$apple would be using now that of course
is just personal opinion
pure speculation but i would not be
surprised one bit to see $apple use the
skateboard technology from $canoe
and if so we see the stock and go to the
moon if any news comes out for a
potential use of the $canoe skateboard
technology towards the $apple car
just having your company name along with
the $apple branding that is absolutely
huge guys all right and this is less of
a technical play as well but we can see
that it does have pretty strong support
that it has held multiple times
at fourteen dollars per share and the
chart does look like it's due for a
reversal and uptrend all the way from
this area
now this is a mid slash longer term play
for me so i'm not looking to be in and
out of the stock
but overall does have a ton of things
going for it they have a huge social
media presence as well they're working
with youtubers such as casey neistat
marquis brownlee they've made contact
with them on twitter i talk about it on
my top 10 long-term stock videos if you
want to check out my full thesis on this
company long term but this company just
doing all the right things
they're very innovative and their
products look very futuristic
all right so next up is $tattoo chef
ticker symbol $ttcf
so this is a technical setup play so
this first of all this company has
earnings on february 8th
that could act be acting as a very
positive catalyst but first off this is
a textbook cup and handle formation so
taking a look we see that cup
formed hit that resistance level at
26.50 and has downtrended
ever since so it has very strong support
at 23 dollars per share
and it has bounced off that multiple
times when it does break this down
trending trend line that's where i
expect the breakout to start
all the way and then a break of 26.50 to
hit all-time highs once again
that's what i personally expect to
happen on this cup and handle breakout
formation
with their earnings coming up it does
have a bunch of things going for right
now i love this as a trade slash
long-term investment short term and long
term here
all right so i'm gonna go ahead and
throw two more quick trade setups in
this video
just because i do think these are very
solid risk award plays so first off is
amc so taking a look at the long-term
chart this is the yearly
chart it has had a triple bottom right
at two dollars per share
having a reversal on that right now
there's lots of rumors going around with
funding deal that they're working on
now the risk for this trade is if they
have another offering and i do have a
stop loss for this position right under
one dollar and ninety cents
but overall i do think this stock is due
as long as nothing goes bad
for a run back to two dollars and
seventy cents pretty low risk
and very solid or potential with a short
float of 35 percent
this could be a very quick mover and
reversal on a bottomed out chart play
all right so the last trade setup for
this coming week is $lagging
pharmaceuticals ticker symbol $lg nd
so this stock is currently trading for
106 dollars per share
and it is sitting at a resistance level
right at 107
so taking a look at the long-term chart
this is the three-year chart we can see
that it did hit past highs at 278
dollars per share
right now it's pretty much sitting at a
hundred dollars per share so it does
have a lot of that
recovery type upside but the thing that
i like the most about this stock
is that it's the second heaviest
shortest stock in the market over 100
short float and almost 70 percent of the
total shares are shorted
so if the stock can break out of this
107 resistance line
i see a big breakout on the way if
shorts start covering we could see this
dog
move very very quickly to 150 dollars
per share now
at the same time this stock could very
easily get rejected at this level that
is sitting at right now
at 107 trend back down but it has had a
triple bottom
at this level as well so things are
setting up nicely here
it has huge award potential pretty low
risk potential as long as you ever stop
a loss in
i'd have my stop loss under where this
triple bottom is at so overall i do like
the short space potential this stock
it is a very solid growing company with
revenues up over 60
year over year almost two times the cash
than debt and overall they're working to
develop technologies to help other
pharmaceutical companies
develop and work on other medicines
worldwide all right so those are my top
five i guess
