this is not financial advice i just hope
you bought your oven mitts baby because
it's about to get hot in the kitchen i
hope you watch your bow tie too cause
it's real hot in the kitchen now let's
get straight to the point hit that
notification bell and subscribe to the
channel and the first banger on the list
is $coinbase and they just came out with
some news before their ipo they're
trying to hype it up and hype the stock
price up baby
hit that patreon link so you could be up
on these plays as early as we are
and hit the weibo link so you can stop
seeing these stocks run up in the
pre-market without you
now let's talk about it $coinbase they
had a post and they said this
$coinbase and q1 2021 it had its best
quarter in the company's history now
this news will likely boost the price
of the shares before april 14th when it
does
its direct listing why did they give
this information out
they want to boost the price up and get
the company basically as much valuable
as they possibly can get it
so that's the breaking news on $coinbase
and they said this
the profit is supposed to be between 730
million
to 800 million they did this again
before
the listing they're trying to blow the
price all the way up it's expected to be
somewhere between
300 and 350 but this type of news let me
tell you right now you might be able to
expect to be even higher than that
but let's keep it going the next banger
on the list
is $neo now let's talk about $neo really
briefly
what's going on with $neo guess what one
of these $neo cars
was spotted in california no camouflage
no nothing
and other than that the real news on $neo
is this
the et7 the first one is finally just
basically all for the production line
let's keep it simple like that it's all
for the production line what are we
doing with $neo we striking to own
make sure you let me know in the
comments how many nil you got and how
many are you trying to get baby because
once they get the sedan rolling out
you already know what time it is they
still didn't even deliver one
so we already know the business is up
even if the stock price is coming down
that's what you need to see so you could
load up somebody asked me why isn't the
hill down
it's down so you could buy it that's
exactly why it's down if you believe in
the company long term
but now let's keep it going the next
banger on the list
is $disney ticker symbol $d-i-s-n
$disney let me tell you this is one of
the top re-opening plays
in the game that you should have as a
cornerstone in your portfolio just
sitting there chilling
and keeping you in the green when your
hot stocks is down let's talk about all
of the things they got going on
all of the things they got going on you
know what their falcon in the winter
soldier
show is doing numbers it had the biggest
opening
weekend of any streaming service show
that they have on the platform with 23
of all of the streaming views and that's
according to
forbes this is according to forbes a
reputable just
institution now let's talk about what
else they got going on they got a show
called loki which is coming out soon and
this is coming out in
june if i'm not mistaken it's coming out
in june
and it's expected to be even bigger than
falcon in the winter soldier
bigger than one division and all of this
other stuff now
they rolling all of these out they even
got something called obi-wan kenobi
coming out
and they just started producing that
this month of april 2021
so you want to get in a play like this
long before they do
anything like that you want to be in a
play and then when they start releasing
all of these things you want to be in it
and on top of that the parks one of the
biggest revenue streams that $disney had
was their theme parks and they're
starting ticket sales
for disneyland in california they
starting at
on april 15th and it should be open
somewhere around
april 30th so all of that revenue is
going to be pouring
right back into $disney what does wall
street think about this
wall street had this to say 22 wall
street analysts they rated this one
and a consensus was this is a strong buy
at the current price
the price targets is this 124 in the low
ain't gonna happen
208 on the median and then 230
on the high but with all of this stuff
they got planned with the parks opening
back up
all of this happening at once this thing
could blow right through that
but even if it don't this would be a
cornerstone of your portfolio
it's time to grow up and get some real
big dog stocks and have them sitting in
the corner of your portfolio baby
now how long we holding this one we
holding this one for 10 years
how we gonna play it this is a stock
that you strike to own so you strike to
own
between 10 and 100 of these shares if
not more than that
but try to load up between 10 and 100 of
these shares and then we're gonna hold
this one for 10 years
if not until retirement so you won't
hold this one for the long haul baby
now let's get to the next banger on the
list if you want me to go to detail
on any of these let me know in the
comments let me know in the comments
now is this it's $atlas crest investment
ticker simple $acic now we've been
talking about this one this is a special
purpose acquisition company
but why is it important right now guess
what it's in the 10
range right now this is important
because for a special purpose
acquisition company
it's very rare that they ever come down
below the 10
range this is the floor for them they
could go down there briefly but it'll be
right back up
it's pretty much a floor and almost if
there was ever a safe investment
then buying a spec at 10 is it
now on top of all of that this company
has the chance to be a
banger in the future and i recently did
a video on this
about a week ago maybe two weeks ago you
might remember when i was talking about
$arc
x the new etf that they got not too long
ago and they included
$acic in there so every time somebody
buys some $ark
x index or not index fund etf every time
somebody buy that remember you know i
should d straight through i keep it real
i keep it raw so i mess up i keep it
right with you baby let's keep it going
so now every time somebody buy some $arc
x what are they gonna be buying a little
bit of
$acic they're gonna buy a small
percentage of $a
c i c now who are they for those who
don't know
this is a company that plans on
disrupting the helicopter
just basically the helicopter industry
how they got these
vertical takeoff and landing electric
vehicles that they want you to basically
fly around
in the city kind of like a taxi but it's
kind of like a helicopter that's quieter
than normal helicopters
and significantly safer cheaper to run
and cheaper to operate
now how we gonna play this one you're
gonna use the strike price
however there's basically only one
because it's basically at the floor of
where it can go
so the strike price the preferable
strike price you could get is the lowest
that it's been in a long time
which is about 9.85 you could get this
under 10 and it would happen extremely
briefly it would be super brief that you
could pick it up there
but if you can consider doing so but in
a ten dollar range as low as possible in
the tens if you're getting a 10 on the
dot
great you get it under 10 even better
baby bow and then
how long are we holding this one you
want to be able to hold on to this one
at least until the end of q2
2021 why because this is when the merger
is supposed to happen
so the few months coming up just
hold on to this one for that time hold
on to this one for q1
20 21 because then the hype coming up
for this merger is going to either send
it up
or send it up and then send it down so
you want to just take it around a ride
go on the wave and then consider getting
out of the play baby
put a stop loss on this once it starts
to run you're going to put your 10
stop loss so if it comes back down guess
what you pure in a profit
just take it and pivot into another play
so now
you could hold on to this one longer
let's be clear on that you could hold on
to this one longer because this one has
a lot of potential to run
in the future because what they're doing
is actually really important
and may just stop traffic from being as
bad as it is
in very densely populated cities so now
let's get to the next banger on the list
and contrary to popular belief whenever
i bring this one up i gotta let you know
$facebook is dominating the game i tell
you every time
you might not be a fan of $facebook but i
bet you a fan of instagram
i bet you a fan of all these other
things that $facebook owns if there was
ever a company that know how to turn
one dollar into two or squeeze a dollar
out of literally anything i'm telling
you one of them is $facebook
they are a beast and barons just
reported an article when they said this
they said that $facebook is closing in on
3 billion
users and it won't be this cheap for
long that's crazy
when you consider how many people are
alive this is approaching half of the
human population
that's absolutely crazy that this many
people
are using $facebook products that that's
that's crazy that's really really crazy
to think about
now $facebook they are four times more
profitable in the last quarter
than they were in the first quarter of
2021 so they even becoming more and more
profitable
it's an extremely profitable business
and during this pullback these last two
pullbacks that we had we've been in this
choppy market
guess what $facebook ain't been pulling
back at all it's been powering straight
through it
because you know what the pullback has a
lot to do
with all kind of factors related to the
pain they're all kind of all kind of
factors but you know what
people are not easing up on $facebook
instagram
whatsapp none of these things they're
not easing up on none of them the
$facebook ads
they're not easing up on them so
$facebook is just powering through
basically all of these pullbacks so keep
that one on your list
35 wall street analysts rated this one a
strong buy
32 of them said it was a buy three say
it was a whole and the price targets is
this
28 on a low or 285 my bad on the low
344 on the median and then 385 on a high
so how do we play this one we're gonna
strike to own again we strike to own
between five and 15 shares of this
company and you already know you gotta
diversify into a big dog like this
so just know they know how to turn one
dollar into two
so we don't hold on to this one for 10
years if not
way way longer than that this is a
banger it's gonna continuously be a
banger
so that's how we plan it and then let's
get to our comment of the day and this
was a special one
comma today is this keenan

picked up side hustles
like doing $door dash $insta shopper
