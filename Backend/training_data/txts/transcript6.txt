$airbnb the $uber of hotels this company
is creating extraordinary social good
and extraordinary economic and
educational empowerment
all within the context of a for-profit
model take a look
i just booked the trip to medellin
colombia and guess who i trusted first
that's right i trusted my stay with
$airbnb $airbnb made people realize that
an extra room in their house or
apartment can be an extra source of
income
not only that but a great way for
travelers to connect you can view
ratings just like you see here
$airbnb spent five months interviewing
their first employee before they hired
someone in their very first year
and they only hired two people that year
this is a true gross story and
opportunity because $airbnb
is going public on december 10th or
maybe even december 9th
the company was founded in 2008 by brian
chesky nathan
b and joe g $airbnb is a shortened
version of its original name
airbed and breakfast.com and in 2015 the
company had 25
million dollars worth of bookings which
is actually a lot for a startup
but by 2019 they had 187
million dollars worth of bookings that's
a 7.5
times bookings in just four years and
for
listings well in 2012 it was a measly
120
000 listings which by the way is bigger
than some small towns
not bad for a company that owns no
property and no
real estate it's simply a platform that
takes a cut of the commission for being
a good middleman
oh and if you're wondering how many
listings in 2019 that they had it was
about
7 million which is almost the size of
new york city
yeah you're gonna want to watch this
video if you want to get stupid rich
and also dare i say my favorite ipo
stock
of 2020 we're gonna have to talk about
this one
to be honest with you guys i do think i
like $airbnb more than i like $plantier
stock
maybe because $airbnb has a network
effect like a true tech giant has
$airbnb is like $facebook in that they
have more users joining the platform
and the more users that join the
platform they do some referring they
tell their friends
and that actually creates an effect
where people join
and more people join because more people
joined if that makes sense it's like
compound
interest $airbnb is now known worldwide
at the end of this video i'll show you
guys some rare gems on $airbnb and some
expensive houses that are not only
fascinating but also raking in some very
massive revenue
and booking fees for $airbnb.com anyways
i'm going to jump in to do a deep dive
analysis here plus tell you guys what
i'm going to be doing with this stock
on the first day of the ipo but first
don't forget to get four free stocks
from weeble in the link below
they hook you up with a ridiculous four
free stocks we're just depositing 100
so check it out all right $airbnb could
be one of the hottest
ipo offerings of the whole year $airbnb
has already been disrupting the hotel in
short-term property rental markets for
years now and investors will soon have a
chance to build a position
in a technology business that is just
growing rapidly
the reason it's growing so fast is
because the business model is truly
disrupting the hotel industry
it makes sense for both the owner and
the customer
i'll start with the owner side of things
okay guys most of the owners can freely
rent a room
or their whole house whenever they like
to and if they want to make some cash on
the side and they want to make some
money to go out
and have fun with that money then all
they have to do is click a few buttons
and put their property or the room
on $airbnb and if they don't they don't
and if they want to rent out the room
for say saturday nights and they want to
have a day or two that they want to make
some money
then they do and if they don't want to
rent the room they can just turn off the
days that they have their rooms
available for
and they don't rent out the room so
they're free to choose when they want to
make money
and utilize their property $airbnb wanted
people to rent out their spare rooms
but check this out guys some people are
turning it into a whole
business people are buying properties
and rather than renting them out like a
traditional landlord they're becoming
$airbnb hosts it makes sense for them
because take a look at this
i live in philadelphia here's an image
of a philadelphia $airbnb
you can see that the total price here is
877
the owner gets 694 for seven
nights but wait i bet you guys didn't
know this but the cleaning fee goes
straight to the owner's pocket as well
so it's really 769 dollars for a week's
stay if three out of four weeks are
booked year round on a good property
that's about two thousand
three hundred dollars per month and i
took a look at the average rent in
philadelphia
and for a two bedroom it's about one
thousand three hundred dollars but let's
call it
a cool 1 500 in rent just to be
conservative so this owner
is more than clearing the typical
monthly rent payment
or if he's renting and then re-putting
the property on $airbnb to make a split
difference some people actually do that
they go ahead they rent a property they
ask their landlords hey
would you mind if i put this on $airbnb
landlord says i don't care
so that person rents and then he puts on
$airbnb that tenant puts it on $airbnb
trying to make a profit people actually
do that anyways back to the point
so you can collect two thousand three
hundred dollars and your rent is about
one thousand five hundred so you're
making that cool
eight hundred dollars per month in
profit now let's talk about the people
that actually rent out
$airbnbs someone in town for a week
traveling would love to have a more
homey experience and honestly $airbnb
oftentimes makes more sense and it costs
less money
to actually rent out than a traditional
hotel as someone who used $airbnb for
years from my trips to europe
and now to colombia the platform makes a
lot of sense
for both the person having the property
and the person looking to rent the
property
and of course for $airbnb which makes
that good
money the company will price a stock
between 56
per share in 60 per share availing the
company around 42 billion dollars at the
upper range and the stock will list on
nasdaq under the ticker $a b
and b $airbnb stock is set to list on
thursday december 10th as i'm making
this video and will likely explode
out of the gate right off the start
because i can see a lot of demand from
investors
becoming really excited about this stock
to be invested in a very fast growing
business
even during the pandemic pressures
because well millennials know that the
value of the company is going to explode
because of the business model
and the network effect that $airbnb has
and by the way something that didn't
really surprise me is that
$airbnb increased the price range for its
initial public offering
this week to 56 to 60 per share
according to the securities and exchange
commission filing released on
monday the 7th it previously planned to
sell shares for 44 to 50
per share roughly and that means that
the new range represents a 27
increase at the bottom end of things any
20 increase at the top end of things
and they're going to be selling 50
million shares and guys what i think is
gonna happen
right off the gate as it does with most
ipos
this year is that they're probably going
to rise
it's not hard for me to say that because
we have seen it
happen over and over again with so many
different ipos and companies
including a majority of over 80 specs
that went public in 2020.
now in my opinion the raising price
isn't the best thing for investors
because you have to purchase a stock at
a more expensive
price but i will say that i do believe
it is justified from one side of the
coin it's the end of the year and i
think people are interested in getting
invested before 2021
and the january effect takes place by
the way if you don't know the january
effect that's basically the effect where
in january the stock market
tends to rise a whole lot and it's an
anomaly because no one knows why that
happens
but i already said it in january stocks
tend to go
up but i will say that the other side of
things is that the private market had
$airbnb a bit lower this year so i'm
slightly concerned
but i don't think that the increase in
their price for their ipo is going to be
a really big issue
6 to 12 to 18 months out because if the
company is growing their revenues
and the pandemic kind of kind of
declines a little bit and people start
traveling again this is going to be an
explosive
stock and even if the pandemic doesn't
really decrease well
i still think people are renting out on
$airbnb because some people live in
$airbnb full-time
check this guy out he lives in $airbnb
full-time now guys we had to discuss
something that makes me feel
very comfortable about $airbnb stock and
the reason i feel comfortable is that
$doordash is also increasing its
valuation and ipowing
very soon check out what yahoo finance
have to say about these two
stocks that's right miles taking a look
here $airbnb and $doordash both heading
towards massive ipos later this week in
two of the largest offerings we'll get
in 2020.
now it's looking like demand for these
share offerings is high especially with
$airbnb
we just saw in a filing this morning
that $airbnb increased the price range
for its ipo
that new range is between 56.60
per share up from the 44.50 per share
that $airbnb had disclosed in a filing
earlier this month
that was pretty interesting i don't
usually look at media too much but i do
think that $doordash and $airbnb coming
high does offer $airbnb some safety
because take a look at $airbnb
revenue in 2019 it was 4.7 billion
now take a look at door dash revenue in
2019
guys it's 1.9 billion it's not even half
of $airbnb so please tell me
how does $airbnb and $doordash have a
similar valuation
that makes no sense at all so at least
relatively speaking $airbnb
is cheap in relation to $doordash's ipo
but we shall see what happens
when they book ipo them coming in at
larger than expected valuations does
kind of hinder the investment returns of
new investors
however i don't think this makes $airbnb
less attractive but as a millennial i'll
be purchasing some shares when they ipo
at least with a small percentage of my
portfolio because i love this stock
i truly believe in it let me know your
guys thoughts below what ipo did you
guys buy that went really well
is $airbnb interesting to you and how
much shares you're going to be buying on
the ipo date
