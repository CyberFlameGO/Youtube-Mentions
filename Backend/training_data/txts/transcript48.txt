wow so $neil stock has been on an
absolute rampage
but mark my words what we've witnessed
so far is nothing
in comparison to what they will achieve
going forward and in fact i am extremely
confident
that $neil will 10x over the next five
years
and if you give me just a few minutes
i'll tell you exactly why
you see the legendary kathy wood was
able to identify and invest
in $tesla all the way back in 2014
and now they are unquestionably
considered the holy grail
when it comes to ev companies by pretty
much everyone
with two eyes and a brain
and as many of you already know $tesla is
my biggest position
by far and for good reason but what most
people fail to realize about $tesla
is that all of this didn't just happen
overnight nor over just a couple of
years
in fact it took them 17 long years since
being founded
way back in 2003 to get to the dominant
position that they're in today
so now let's compare that to $neo who is
a promising young
hungry competitor who just came into
existence
a measly six years ago and is priced
right now
like $tesla was back in 2013
but the truth of the matter is that $neo
is much further along
in the process than $tesla was seven
years ago
so in this video i'm going to be sharing
some information that will not only
shock you
but it'll make you think twice about not
having some $neo in your portfolio
but more on that later so i am beyond
excited to share this information with
you guys
and i'd appreciate an early thumbs up as
these videos do take a really long time
to make
but with that being said let's not waste
any more time and let's get right into
it so i first recommended buying $neo
stock on this channel back when it was
trading at just under
12 dollars a share so for all of my
subscribers who bought in
then you've already more than doubled
your money in just a few months
so major congrats now me personally not
only will i not be selling a single
share of $neo anytime soon but i actually
plan on doubling
my position because there are three
major catalysts in particular
that are all quietly taking shape at the
same time
and will be the difference maker for $neo
and we'll be outlining
each of them along with going over some
key factors that not many people are
talking about
or even realizing and yet they will have
massive implications
on $neo stock going forward so the first
major catalyst is without a doubt the
record-breaking demand
and with it their newfound ability to
scale
profitably you see in just two weeks
they will be reporting earnings
and due to the fact that the automotive
industry shares their delivery numbers
well in advance i can already tell you
that they will almost
undoubtedly be shattering analyst
revenue
expectations for this quarter because
they had more than
triple digit growth in both monthly and
cumulative
sales with q3 deliveries growing to 12
206 vehicles which is up over a hundred
and fifty percent
year over year but also and even more
importantly
they will likely be announcing that
they've achieved a record high gross
margin which is key
because up until this year they were
actually losing money on each and every
vehicle that they sold
which is obviously unsustainable but
this year they took a massive leap in
the right direction
with gross margins on their vehicles
coming in at 10 percent
for q2 and since then their ceo lee bin
has dropped a multitude of hints in
interviews pointing towards the fact
that their margins
have gotten even better so i wouldn't be
surprised at all
if they managed to get that number all
the way up to the 12
to 15 range for the third quarter which
would be huge for them
but now here's where things get really
interesting you see based on what we
already know
it's likely that $neo will deliver around
40 to 45
000 vehicles in total this year but they
have also confirmed
that by the end of 2021 they should be
able to manufacture up to 150
000 vehicles and then 300 000 by 2022
and at their current trajectory analysts
are expecting them to be profitable
by 2023 which is extremely impressive
especially when you consider that it
took $tesla well over 14
years to become profitable and for them
to have the ability to scale up quickly
and profitably is extremely important
especially considering that they can't
even keep up with the current demand
as it is right now with several outlets
reporting that they have a backlog
of over a month or two worth of orders
and new potential customers are being
quoted wait times
of several weeks just to receive their
cars
which brings us to our second catalyst
and that's $neo's special sauce
you see it's no surprise that the man
for their cars has been through the roof
because they've managed to turn
themselves into a lifestyle brand of
sorts
with an almost cult-like following and
that has translated to their average
customer referral rate
skyrocketing this year to over 62
in the first half of 2020 which beats
out iconic brands
like $bmw $mercedes-benz and even
$tesla and what this simply means is that
customers who buy
$neo cars absolutely end up loving them
so much so in fact that they go on to
refer their family and friends
and for $neal to have such a high level
of customer satisfaction
and loyalty despite being such a young
brand
is very impressive and no small
accomplishment
and they're building and nurturing those
relationships with their customers
through a plethora of unique premium
offerings and services
including $neo house which is almost like
an underground exclusive cafe
that is only available to $neo users and
their friends
also all $neo cars have the ability to
swap out their batteries
in three minutes or less meaning in the
time that it takes you to finish
watching another tai lopez ad
here in my garage just bought this uh
new lamborghini so before you can even
learn the secrets to get rich in five
minutes your car is already fully
charged and ready to go
which is pretty badass considering that
it takes a $tesla
over an hour to get a full charge at a
supercharger station
but that's not all because $neo's battery
swaps are a super power of sorts for
them
and one that they are now transforming
into a new business model
entirely that'll be known as battery
as a service which they just officially
launched
last month and what makes this so
special is the fact that they will now
be able to undercut
the majority of their competitors
because it enables customers to buy the
car
without the battery itself and as we
should all know by now
the battery is by far the most expensive
single part
of any electric vehicle so this will
save customers
upward of ten thousand dollars in
upfront cost
when purchasing their electric car and
instead they can now simply sign up for
a battery subscription plan
for as little as a hundred and forty
dollars a month so this will make $neo
cars significantly more affordable
to more people which will cause demand
to surge
tremendously over the next couple of
years and just two weeks ago they
announced that they have now officially
done over 1 million battery swaps with
one car
in particular having swapped out his
battery over
500 times which is kind of crazy to even
think about
so clearly their customers absolutely
love the feature
some maybe even a little too much but it
doesn't end there you see $tesla's not
the only company working towards
achieving
full self-driving and unlocking all of
the revenue potential that comes with it
that's where $neo's partnership with
mobileye comes into place
a company that was acquired by intel in
2017
but who has been working on achieving
full autonomy since the early
2000s and in fact up until 2016
$tesla was using some of mobile eyes
technology
for their version 1 of autopilot that
was until an
unfortunate crash occurred at which
point both sides basically started
pointing fingers at each other
and things got pretty messy so the
partnership was ultimately terminated
but
fast forward to today just a couple of
years later and both companies are
thriving
and while i have no doubt that $tesla is
by far leading the way
in achieving full autonomy mobile eyes
technology is still
undoubtedly impressive and should not be
completely ignored
in fact they've even released footage of
a 40-minute autonomous ride in the busy
streets of jerusalem
with their camera only system similar to
$tesla's setup
without requiring any bulky expensive
lidar system so in my opinion mobile eye
is by far
the second closest runner-up to $tesla
when it comes to achieving full
self-driving
and they actually have plans to release
a full robo taxi service
in early 2022 in several countries
including jerusalem france korea
and china and here's where the massive
opportunity lies for $neo
because they have agreed to mass produce
the full self driving system
for mobileye but also to integrate the
technology
into its own electric vehicles for both
the consumer markets and for mobile eyes
driverless ride ride-hailing service
meaning that they will be the main
supplier for mobile eye's global
robo-taxi fleet which would be a
tremendous growth driver for $neo
not only due to the large amount of
orders that they could get directly from
mobileye
themselves but also since they will be
able to implement the full self-driving
technology
into their own consumer cars which will
entice even more customers
to the brand and the sale of the
software add-on will help increase their
margins
drastically so now the third and final
catalyst
we'll go over this one rather quickly
since it's almost self-explanatory in
the sense that it becomes
quite obvious once you just put the
pieces of the puzzle
together and that is the fact that $neo
has a tremendous
almost built-in unfair advantage
over $tesla in china and this is
important to know because remember
china's ev market is about four times
that of the us not only that but by 2025
china wants 25 of all new cars sold
to be electric and that number will
skyrocket
to 60 by 2035 so the exponential growth
that the ev sector as a whole
will be experiencing over the next
decade in china alone
is unquestionable and $neo is setting
themselves up
to be in the perfect position to
capitalize
on this exponential growth also let's
not forget that just earlier this year
when $neo was on the brink of bankruptcy
the chinese government basically bailed
them out with a one billion dollar
investment
from several state-owned companies in
return for a 24
stake in $neo so the chinese government
would not even allow them to fail at
this point
because they themselves own a
significant stake in $neo
but it doesn't just end there because
china has a long
long history of doing whatever it takes
to ensure that chinese companies
have the upper hand over american
companies so if you think that china is
going to let $tesla
an american company just eat up all the
eevee market share in china forever
you are absolutely crazy just ask
apple who has seen its market share
dwindle down to just
five percent over the years compared to
huawei
who absolutely dominates the chinese
market with close to half of the market
share
in large part due to them getting a ton
of special treatment from the government
in the form of easy access to financing
and high levels of government sponsored
grants
and subsidies so guys i am becoming more
and more bullish on $neo stock and i
truly believe that this is a 10x
opportunity
in the making that you do not want to
miss out on but as always i don't want
to just mention the positives
but also the risk because as with any
investment there are of course risks
that come with it
and the biggest one to me would be the
simple fact
that $neo is a chinese company and so
that makes them more vulnerable
to political tensions but look at the
end of the day both countries are two
massive
superpowers that benefit tremendously
from one another
and so whenever it's needed they will
get in a room together
and work things out as they usually do
now another concern that investors often
have
especially after a stock has such a
massive run-up
as $neo-stock has recently had is the
potential for a big pullback
and while that is definitely possible
just remember that many people were
saying that a huge pullback
was going to happen to $tesla back when
they were trading at seven hundred
dollars
then nine hundred dollars then twelve
hundred dollars
and we all know how that movie played
out so as long as you're a long-term
investor
don't worry about the short-term dips
because over the long run those small
dips will be
absolutely irrelevant in comparison to
what this company's potential is
over the next 5 to 10 years especially
considering that they are still just in
their early infancy stage
and so the best time to invest in a high
growth company
like $neo is before they truly start to
scale
because that's when they will take
things to a whole other stratosphere
so my recommendation is to always just
dollar cost average in
it's the best strategy by far and one
that has been proven to work
time and time again also real quick in
case you missed the announcement
