today's video we're talking about two
stocks that have seen some crazy
movement lately
that is $nano dimension stock ticker
symbol $nndm
and $sensionic stock ticker symbol
$s-e-n-s
i mean in just the last one week we've
seen a similar trend in both stock price
$nndm is down by 10 to 8 dollars and 30
cents
and cents is also down by 10 to 2.68
now yes we saw a nice jump yesterday
$sense was up 10
during the day and $nndm was also up two
and a half percent
to eight dollars and forty one cents i'm
sure if you've been holding on to $ndm
and $$send stock then you're probably
wondering what the heck is going on
and when can we expect the stock price
to bounce back
well $nndm and $sensonics both are very
revolutionary in my opinion
and they're working on bringing a very
disruptive product to the market so in
today's video let's discuss
all the latest updates on $nndm and
$sensonic stock
should you buy these two stocks right
now or just wait it out a little bit
upcoming catalyst to keep an eye on and

and $$send stock price prediction

it truly means a lot to me oh and feel

also in the description below
so first let's start with talking about
$nano dimension stock and in dm
now i have made a full detailed video on
$nndm stock just beginning of last month
and i told you guys i wasn't quite sure
of $nndm until this year 2021
when i finally bought the shares in
january after looking more into its
technology and numbers
and now i am on board with you guys i
truly believe
$nndm is headed to another dimension i
mean if you've been looking for a next
big thing this my friend is it so
looking at the $nndm stock price it
closed yesterday at eight dollars and 35
cents which was up by
1.7 and also up another 0.6
aftermarket to 8.40 mind you it was
barely a dollar stock in september of
2020 and has gone up crazy 250
in last six months now if you're
wondering what is $nanodimension
it is a leader in the highly promising
3d printing electronics industry the
company is particularly focused on
disrupting the pcb markets which is
printed circuit boards which currently
acts as a pillar of electronic devices
the pcb market is currently worth around
60 billion
dollars which is not surprising given
how universal the technology is
i think $nano dimension is well
positioned to disrupt this market
and if they manage to gain even a small
footprint in the pcb industry
the company will see far more upside no
doubt about it and on top of that we're
talking about 3d printing pcbs which is
sure to open up
far more possibilities i say this
because pcbs have the potential to
become more complex when they're no
longer confined to the 2d space
now keep in mind despite its high
potential $nearer dimension is still in
its very early stage which makes it a
little bit of a risky investment
and the main reason why i was skeptical
to investing in it before but like it or
not
3d printing pcbs are the technology of
the future
sure it will take some time for the
industry to transition its entire
infrastructure from 2d to 3d
but it's coming oh yeah coming sooner
than we think
and recently kathy wood discussed $nndm
and why she holds several positions
she said and i quote $nmdm has turned
itself into a broader application
3d printed technology device company one
of the important things about nano
dimension stories they're contracts
they're winning from the defense agency
we always look for where the defense is
putting their money our next generation
internet etf currently holds over
5.8 million shares of $nano dimension
stock
oh and check this out $nndm stock is arc
autonomous
etf's single largest holding in terms of
shares with nearly 7 million shares
owned and valued at 1.77
of total allocation now in terms of my
price prediction for $nndm stock
well in the past three years $nndm has
increased their revenue at a steady
price
and now as the world recovers from the
whole rona thing i think the next two
years are going to be pretty big for the
company
sure the stock has been down lately from
its all-time highs but hey remember
red days in the market are great
opportunity to
lower your dollar cost and load up on
the stock that you truly believe in
i am in $nndm for the long term therefore
i'm not panicking or getting
impatient with the ups and downs in the
price i really believe that
$nanodimension has the right kind of
qualities to become one of the next
big thing in tech i hate to say this but
just know that impatience
will get us nowhere in the stock market
nobody likes when the market is red but
then it's also unfair to accept it to be
green
all the time but i can see that $nmdm
stock will definitely double in the next
couple months
so moving on to the second stock which
is one of my favorite penny stock that
is $sensionic stock ticker symbol $s-e-n-s
since stock is up crazy 600 in last six
months
no kidding that is really really good
growth for a penny
stock $sense also has a market cap a
whopping 1.2 billion dollars now if
you're not familiar with the company
then to put it in couple lines
$sense is a medical device maker and its
main product is continuous glucose
monitoring cgm
system called eversense it is truly a
unique and powerful invention for people
with diabetes
i mean it's the world's only fda
approved long-term
implantable system where you can
actively manage your diabetes with super
ease
so just recently $sanseonix reported its
q4 2020 and full year earnings report
i covered that in my last video but what
caught my eyes was their estimates for
2021
they expect net revenue for full year
2021 to be between 12 to 15 million
dollars
now that is four times more than 2020
revenue of 4.9 million i get it as an
investor into this penny company you're
probably wondering
what the heck are they talking about
will they really grow their revenue
four times well i understand how you
feel but let's talk about why i believe
they will pull it off
and the reason the company is poised for
growth this year so just recently
$sensonics partnered with $ascendis
diabetes care which is a 10 billion
dollar
global leader in the diabetes technology
space this is exciting news and as for
the ceo
it will help the company in increasing
their global footprint and growing the
market for ever since in 2021
and beyond we know sales are bound to
grow no question about it
sure in the short term with any penny
stock we're going to see high volatility
but i am optimistic in $sensonic's
groundbreaking diabetes technology
and its recent big expansion it has so
much potential and it can create a lot
of revenue here in the us
and worldwide i think they will pull it
off and can double their market cap by
bringing the new technology into the
market currently fda is reviewing their
application for approval of a new and
more advanced sensor
which will last 180 days it is set to be
approved by i think august 31st and this
will
totally change the game in the glucose
monitoring system world
in addition to that since joining plans
to bring out 365-day sensor to market
which will last
full year in next couple years that's
exciting now in terms of my $send stock
price prediction
like i have said in my previous video
$send stock is definitely a 8 to 10
dollar stock which will rise pretty fast
so take advantage of the red day in the
market
and buy before it hits three dollars i'm
not a financial advisor but in my
opinion
if you were bullish before then stay
bullish now no need to panic
and as a reminder for any penny stock
only invest if you have the stomach to
ride out potential volatility
never put in more money than you're
willing to lose anyways that is my take
on $nndm
and $sends talk as to where both the
companies are headed and their stock
price in the long term
