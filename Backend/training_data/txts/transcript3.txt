money makers today we're talking about
the top stock to buy during the first
week of march
especially especially from the market
tanking last week whereas pretty much
every single day was a red market day
however by the end of market close today
we actually seen a rejuvenation
of our jump back to nearly pre-dipped
levels the $s p 500 up 2.3 percent $dow
jones are nearly up 2
and $nasdaq up 3 and this is all really
based on a couple of really great news
first one is the house past the 1.9
trillion dollar relief package
meaning it's off to the senate now as
well as really really strong economic
data coming out now i'm not going to be
super optimistic and say it's going to
be peachy keen green every single day
this week
i do expect still some short-term
volatility coming up but regardless
before we get into the top stock to add
this week let's quickly recap a couple
of stocks that we've been buying as well
as selling
but first the only thing i ask of you in
return is to hit that like button and
turn it into a beautiful
beautiful blue and if you are new here
make sure you smash the subscribe button
and ring the notification bell
to join the money makers family the
first talk we want to talk about is
$calera ticker symbol $klr or i called the
$twilio twin i'm still very bullish on
the stock we got in at ten dollars and
it closed today's trading day at 19.12
and despite the markets actually being
very red the past few days $clera was
actually a very very dependable stock
pretty much every single day last week
it closed higher than originally
expected and even on friday
when everything else was tanking it
actually reached its 52-week high
at 19.39 now one thing i do want to
mention is that insiders
have actually been selling which caused
the stock to quiver today however
honestly i do welcome some quivering
this stock has been on a tear
pretty much every single day you can see
there's no solid support line forming
as well as it's in the overbought
territory right now now my original
price target for this stock was 25
however with their recent acquisition
increasing their margin i'm actually
even more bullish
i'm increasing my price target to 30
dollars but of course do not be afraid
to take profits because again
this is a very volatile stock without
any solid support lines right now
next up is $copen ticker symbol $k-o-p-n
$copen actually jumped around 10
today ending the trading day at nine
dollars and 20 cents and
like i've mentioned last time i actually
opened a position last week when the
rsi actually dipped below the overbought
territory now keep in mind i plan to
hold this stock for the long term i'm
very bullish on the future prospect of
ar
and vr technology and since $copen is a
pick and shuffle play i'm very bullish
on this now keep in mind $copen is
probably going to be very volatile
tomorrow because they do have their
earnings announcement and like we've
seen with a lot of different stocks
even if the report is extremely
extremely positive we still see stocks
tank after the earnings come out but
then i do believe in $copen in the long
term and i do believe that it will
recover now before i get into the next
couple of recaps as well as the stock to
check
out in the first week of march i do want
to let you guys know that the patreon is

welcome aboard you can check out the
patreon link the first link down below
i do want to talk about $kmph that went
up around three percent today and
honestly $kmph has been pulling on our
heartstrings very very much
i was honestly expecting a lot more
runway today especially since the
fda approval is coming tomorrow on march
2nd and i was planning to play this with
buy the rumor and sell the news and by
no means am i disappointed by this stock
at all because we did get into this at
the lower seven dollar range
and today hit around ten dollars and
fifty cents today i did sell a portion
of my shares in $kmph when it was above
the 10
mark and i locked in a good amount of
profit almost 38 40 percent
in gains now the remaining shares of
that i have of this stock i'm going to
be riding until tomorrow
and see how the fda approval plays out
but the reason i sold off a couple of my
shares is to really cover a majority of
my initial investment
and the rest of the money that i have in
this is pretty much just free money now
before we get into the top stock to
check out in the first week of march
i'm gonna be talking about $pounds here
mainly because a lot of you guys are
requesting updates on this
$pound here close to trading they add
24.81
with around a 3.81 percent gain i think
$pounds here still looks very very
attractive at this price again as i said
anything under 30
i've been scooping up shares pretty much
every single day of early last
week i haven't pulled the trigger again
today mainly because
i need to redeploy my capital elsewhere
i already have a healthy portion of
$pounds here in my portfolio
i might reconsider and purchase more
shares later on my original price target
of around 50
dollars still holds but i've been
getting a lot of questions on we've been
seeing a lot of insiders selling in
vincent
should we be selling should this be a
worrying sign because insiders are
getting rid of their shares
and normally that's a pretty bearish
outlook and my response is i don't think
insider selling is
necessarily an absolute negative we
really have to take a deeper look into
the situation
and see what are all the conditions
around it now the situation for $pounds
here since they very recently
ended their lock up period meaning that
insiders can start selling
it does make sense that these insiders
actually sell off some of their shares
because many of these big players
insiders actually owns millions and
millions of shares of $pounds here and
more likely to not pounce here is a
massive
portion of their overall portfolio
investment and these $palantir insiders
are smart guys they know about the rule
of diversification
so if they want to reduce volatility in
their overall investment portfolio
they're going to offload a couple
hundred thousands of shares in order to
make it more in line
relative to their overall portfolio so
in short
i'm not worried about these insider
sellings at the current moment now the
top stock to watch to your portfolio
in the first week of march actually is
looking very very attractive at this
price
because of last week's sell-off it's
called $tiger brokers
ticker symbol $t-i-g-r $tiger ended the
trading day at 25.71
and we'll very quickly go over three key
things one is the overview
number two is the financials and number
three what are the risks involved in
investing in this stock
so firstly $tiger is a chinese brokerage
platform
for the global investor that originally
started in china and it's backed by
massive players such as $xiaomi which is
a massive chinese company that you might
have heard of before
as well as $interactive brokers from the
united states now $tiger's main total
addressable market is of course china
since it's based in china but we'll talk
about its expansion plans in just a few
minutes
but the tam right now is insanely
massive at 30.2
trillion dollars that's right with a t
trillion and this
tan or total addressable market is
expected to exceed the united states in
the next couple
of decades since they started in 2014
$tiger brokers already has over 1 million
customers
with 214 000 funded accounts they
facilitate over billions and billions of
dollars of trade
every single day with their last q3
earnings they facilitated over 63
billion dollars in trades now $tiger is
very attractive to people who are
looking to open a brokerage account
because
they have the lowest commissions
available amongst brokerage platforms
relative to other competitors such as
$futu
and like we mentioned although they are
starting in china they're also expanding
into other countries such as singapore
new zealand and etc in fact chinese
clients only account for around 20
of their total funded accounts but their
low commissions is not the only reason
clients are actually attracted to
signing up with $tiger another reason is
actually the loophole in $tiger's main
system
if you are a chinese investor a lot of
the really high-tech companies and
attractive market opportunities
are listed on the us or hong kong-based
exchanges and as a chinese investors
there are limitations because of foreign
currency
however $tiger actually has a loophole
around this which makes it a very
attractive opportunity for these
investors now despite this do keep in
mind that they only have around 20
of their signups actually funded because
they do have a relatively
challenging signup process where they do
request a lot of documentation but they
did recently partner with an ai
platform with one of the objectives of
helping people actually
encourage them from not only signing up
with their account but also actually
funding their account and providing
those verification documents so that is
a step in the right direction
in being able to convert some of these
signups into actual funded users but
another thing that really excites me
about $tiger is their diversification
into different revenue streams because
we know brokerage commissions is one
but they're also expanding into other
financial services and one of the most
attractive ones is going to be
investment banking where they
essentially help
companies go public in q3 of 2020 they
already helped eight companies go
publicly listed and there are
expectations to work with even more
companies in the future and honestly
going ipo or through this investment
banking route this is where a lot of
revenue can come
in and be generated now let's dive into
$tigers financials which are actually
very very impressive $tiger actually
doubled their revenue for three
consecutive quarters
in 2020 and is growing faster than any
united states or hong kong brokerage
platforms $tiger also recently became
profitable and they're expected to
increase their profit margin even more
because they recently acquired their own
clearinghouse called moscow where they
were previously clearing through
$interactive brokers which you saw was
one of the main investors and by
clearing through a third party which
they didn't own that kind of cut into
their profit margins and due to their
recent acquisitions
obviously they're trying to bring
everything in-house which shows their
commitment to improving their platform
increasing their financials and owning
every step of the process
now do keep in mind they have increased
their expenses as well
for example their marketing and branding
expenses more than 2x to 3.7 million
from 1.5 million dollars
however i'm personally fine with this
because as a fast growing tech startup
they need to acquire more customers not
only in china
but also with their expansion efforts
into singapore and new zealand and etc
now before we dive into the risk section
that you definitely want to keep in mind
before you think about even
investing in this company i do want to
let you guys know that these due
diligence reports you can see them in a
lot more details on the patreon where i
post my research my findings
as well as a bunch of other benefits the
first risk is that a majority of $tiger's
accounts are not funded although they
are
signed up only around 20 actually have
money in them $tiger definitely needs to
work on converting these users into
actually funding your accounts and we've
seen a step in the right direction
with their partnership with an ai
platform to do so the second risk is
that chinese investors historically have
mostly invested in real estate or save
the actual money
instead of purchasing stocks however
$tiger is targeting the millennial market
and we have seen a lot more
interest from chinese investors in
investing in the stock market so this
might be a perfect time for them to do
so the third risk is that the typical
chinese investment sentiment comes in
here
these numbers could be fake they could
be targeted by a short sale report
etc etc so do understand the risk that
you are taking
when you are thinking of investing in
$tiger as always a daily dose of homework
