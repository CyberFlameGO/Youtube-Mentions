hope you're having a great day out there
as always here today i'm going to share
with you
five unbelievable stocks five b stocks
that i hardly ever talk about recently
in 2021 these are stocks that i own and
i used to talk about them a lot in 2020
however i haven't been talking about
them much at all the last few months and
a lot of people are wondering do you
still own these stocks
what's your opinion on these stocks
things like that so i said let's do a
video today that updates
on this whole situation recently over
the past few months
i've been talking a lot about obviously
$tesla $the planet
$crsr rate $corsair gaming $tattooed chef
$ttcf
$ggtf and $facebook okay those have been
the stocks i've
really heavily talked about the last few
months but there's other stocks that i
was talking about a lot in 2020 that i
just kind of
haven't really talked about so we're
gonna get in that guys hope you enjoy
this video as always don't forget to
smash the thumbs up as always i do
appreciate you guys
smashing as much as possible if you're
looking to apply from a private stock
group so you can learn how to scale your
portfolios to six figure seven figures
eight figures and up from there that
will be linked in the description might
also have that is the pinned
comment down there already guys let's
start getting into these five stocks
first one
up here is the $very good food company
ticker symbol $v
r yyf it's been a while since i've
really talked about this one this was a
stock i was talking about quite a bit
in 2020 it was a stock i was super
excited about
and i was buying it's about a 400
million market cap company
they're in the plant-based food space
they're growing rapidly
and this is supposed to be a big
expansion year for them okay
so first off do i still own the stock
yes i do i own
literally every single share i
ever bought in this company so forty
thousand
one hundred shares in total and the
stock has done
very well for us and i have absolutely
no interest
in selling out of this stock and
something you know something that kind
of bugs me
you know being in my position you know i
understand like
you know having like the notoriety in
the stock market space is awesome and
you get to make a lot of money on
youtube and those sorts of things
one of the annoying things is like
people just make some people okay
a very select percentage but there is
that amount out there
that literally will just make up lies
about me and say oh he sold out of that
stock it was just a pump and dump
because he hasn't talked about it in
like two months or something like that
and it's like
listen man i own a lot of stocks like it
doesn't mean i have to talk about each
one of these stocks
every single day or something like that
so i still own every single
share i've ever bought in the $very good
food company a lot of good news has come
out recently
in regards to $very good food company
look at this february 18th
the $very good food company announces
increased distribution
with national retailers february 24th
the $very good food company completes
acquisition of $the culture nut in march
9th which is
today the $very good food company
announces signing of committed
canadian 70 million dollar credit
facility
non-binding term sheet with prominent
institutional
investment firm as well as the $very good
food company recently announced a new
director of u.s sales
and provides e-commerce update all right
so
$the culture nut acquisition okay this is
this is something that has definitely
some big long-term potential they
basically acquired this company it's a
highly popular
artisan vegan cheese producer on the
west coast of canada
with current sales distribution and
several online and grocery retailers
including
select whole foods stores all right and
if you think about this space long term
i mean it is absolutely
massive $culture nuts products current
average wholesale price is four dollars
per unit and very intends to scale
$culture nuts existing production
facility to over 100
000 units per month in 2021
with plans to scale production further
in 2022
to ensure a successful business
integration the founders
of $the cultured nut and certain other
key employees have entered into
employment agreements
with $veri and the transaction structure
includes conditional
payments based on the achievement of
production
and product innovation milestones i like
that okay so these these
folks coming over we're going to be very
incentivized
to build that business much much larger
build these volumes up
get more distribution and all those
sorts of things i love this okay
the very a few months ago had their
earnings come out by the way the next
very earnings will probably come out in
the next i would say 30 to 45 days
man look at the revenue growth 322
percent
year over year gross margins are going
way up for this business
the business is just clicking on all
cylinders
huge potential here long term they're in
such a good financial position versus
when i first started investing in this
company
and ultimately the $very good food
company is a long-term hold for me
still hold all 40 100 shares time will
tell
where this one goes long term i'm a big
believer in it that's why i continue to
hold the shares despite being up
you know considerable amounts of money
still hold all the shares
and i look at this and i say what if
they can just become a fraction of the
size of beyond meat long term
you know i think this definitely can be
a company that gets to a billion or two
billion dollars in market cap over time
maybe maybe even bigger than that but it
remains to be seen obviously they have
to execute on a high level
right now it's a 400 million dollar
market cap so i'm gladly holding that
one
for the long term it's it's one of my
three plays in that space basically $ttcf
a $very good food company and beyond me
beyond me in that space is arguably
maybe the safest right because
they're the big dog they're doing
partnerships with everybody tdcf is kind
of that
you know i think it has limited downside
but also massive upside and the very
good food company probably has the
biggest potential upside
but obviously that one's the biggest
risk of the bunch because obviously they
are
the smallest but yeah $very good food
company i
love that company that's why i still
hold every single share i've ever bought
in a company i plan to continue to and
we'll see where things go over the next
few years with a $very good food company
alright guys next stock up here number
two
of five is $revolve group ticker symbol
$rv
lv haven't talked about this one in
quite a while okay
47 stock here today 3.3 billion dollar
market cap the stock has been just a
consistent
climbing stock for the past year i mean
you look at that chart
and i love a chart like that there's no
like necessarily time where just
skyrocketed
and then fell a bunch it's just
consistently thrived and thrived they
play in the e-commerce space
with apparel i like the management team
in place for this company
they continue to grow beastly on this
okay
as far as my holdings for the stock i
hold 111
000 worth of shares in the public
account that's 2
375 shares at a cost basis of eleven
dollars and eighty six cents
we're up eighty three thousand dollars
on those ones there
and then in my main private account i
didn't build that position nearly big
enough in my main private account
it's actually one of the smallest
positions i think it's either the second
smallest or third smallest position
in my big dog private account it only
had 56 thousand dollars in it there so
i wish i would have built that so much
dang bigger in that account i just was
slacking i was just slacking on that one
but needless to say i'm a big believer
in this company i hold 1200
shares in the main private account as
well this company should be able to grow
massively for years to go in the future
i'm talking years to go in the future
and build into a very very profitable
business model that
starts to become very consistent okay as
far as this year they're expected to
grow revenues
over 18 next year they're expected to
grow revenues over 17 percent
so this is one of those companies that
they should be able to grow double
digits
per year every year for you know as long
as i can see like like pretty much for
the next five ten years i expect them to
grow double digits
top line year after year after year okay
and remember i talked about i think this
company is going to be very very
profitable long term okay
and here's here's what expectations are
they're expected to do
70 cents eps in 2021. don't be surprised
at all if that number
ends up being low and i'm talking
really low do you see that 2022 number
97 cents
don't be surprised at all if they end up
coming in
with that type of number in 2021
okay where do you think that stock price
is going if they come in with that type
of number
it reminds me seeing they obviously got
to put up some impressive numbers they
got to execute on a high level
but i'm just looking at that 70 cents
and i'm saying i think that could
potentially be actually
really really underwhelmingly low i
think there's going to be there's huge
pent-up demand
for apparel clothing and those sorts of
things this year
in 2021 just i feel like a huge pent-up
demand
i mean people weren't really doing stuff
last year and you know this is going to
be the year where people start getting
back to life as normal right especially
in the back half of the year
going on trips vacations oh guess what
you do a lot of people
you know love to buy new clothes when
they're about to go on vacation or you
got to go to that concert
go to that sporting event things like
that and apparel sales do very well in
that environment
and so this company regardless over the
next several years should become
a very very profitable business throw
off lots of cash flows
they should be able to expand the
business bigger and bigger put more
money into advertising marketing getting
the word out about this company maybe
making acquisitions
expanding this business more overseas
and yeah
$rvlv is a long-term hold for me another
one of those stock set
i don't care what price it goes to in
the short term i'm a holder of this
company
i'll gladly continue to hold those
shares that i hold and and i'm happy
with that
and we'll see how things play out but i
know the management team there i like
those guys a lot
i think they i think they have a very
bright future in front of themselves and
i think they could be
one of the biggest players if not the
biggest player in e-commerce when it
comes to pure clothing sales
average order at $rvlv is usually like i
think it's like 300 bucks man
not a small amount at all right alrighty
guys let's get into the next stock up
here
number three or five of these stocks and
that is
$dropbox ticker symbol $dbx so this stock
in 2020 i was talking about it so much
in the back half of 2020 people got sick
of me talking about this stock all the
damn time okay
but this year i haven't really been
talking about that much but i gotta say
i love this company more than ever
before just because i don't talk about
it much
lately doesn't mean i don't love this
company because i do okay about 10
billion dollar mark cap
they're in the cloud space smart
workspace e-signing of documents it's
had a very interesting acquisition here
today that i'm going to share with you
okay
so in the public account i hold 123
thousand dollars
worth of shares in that account we're up
26 000 on them there okay
in my main private account i hold 246
000
worth of $dropbox in that account we're
up over forty four thousand
that one as far as i also in an options
account
i hold essentially like almost forty
thousand dollars worth of call options
in an options account okay
we have eighteen thousand so far on that
those call options which
call option if you don't know it's
basically a bet that a stock price is
going to a certain price by a certain
date
those expire in january of 2023 okay so
i have a few years to play with there
they're at a 20 strike price okay i
think i'm going to make out like a
bandit on those let's just put it that
way you know when i sell out of that
it's probably going to be worth a
hundred thousand dollars we'll see what
happens you know maybe i'm wrong
i think i'm going to sell out and it's
going to be six figures of those those
those call options over the next year or
two because keep in mind i don't
have to hold those call options until
january 2023 if i don't want okay
and then also in this random chase
account i have that's like a little
brokerage account
i have like forty six thousand dollars
worth of $dropbox stock in that account
as well and this is another one of those
things that the very small percentage
i'll
see lies like this out there $drop boxes
or crap stock it's a bum stock you're
losing money left and right on that
you know what a dumb stock pick and i'm
like you know
the fact is we're up nearly six figures
now
on $dropbox nearly six figures yeah it's
not my best performing stock i've ever
had i've had a lot better performing
stocks than $dropbox
but the other day there's a stock i've
been in for what six to nine months
and we're up nearly six figures in the
stock so you know
that's the unfortunate thing people will
make up lies about you and say whatever
they want just
you know i don't know if some people are
uneducated or they just want to see you
fail or whatever but i'm just like
when i read stuff like that i'm just
like what are they doing okay but
anyways $dropbox
is a beast and the stock will be
respected i can promise you that
the stock can get disrespected for for a
while but then it always turns around
and over time the market recognizes the
beast okay
and $dropbox is a beast okay as far as
revenue growth expected to do double
digits
in 2021 next year expected eight point
eight percent
they're gonna do double digits in my
opinion next year as well as far as
revenue growth goes okay
as far as eps 93 cents of eps back last
year and then a dollar 27
expected in current year okay
so expected for massive eps growth in
this year and then up to a dollar 43 in
2022
this is a thing a lot of people have
missed out on $dropbox okay
it's not just about the revenue growth
story it's not just about the fact that
they have
like virtually no customer concentration
recurring revenue streams
it's one of the most beautiful business
models i hold if not the most and it's
needs based it's probably the most
beautiful business model i arguably hold
out of any business i hold out there but
people have just consistently
forgotten about the fact that this is a
business that is just starting
to reach massive cash flows and wait to
see where the cash flows come over the
next few years
remember this company has talked about a
billion dollars of free cash flow i
think by year 2025
and people are just kind of like uh
whatever $dropbox
and i'm like dude you're missing out on
a potential 2x 3x 4x stock
with very limited downside that's the
best part of this this stock has
easily 2x 3x 4x potential over the
coming years in my opinion
but it also has an extremely low
probability this stock drops 50
or something like that and these are the
type of stocks i thrive with
when they have extremely high
probabilities of doubling or more than
doubling over the next three five years
and extremely low probabilities of
dropping 50 plus over the next three
five years
that's what makes a magical stock for me
okay
$dropbox just announced this here today
$dropbox to acquire secure document
sharing startup
doc send for 165
million dollars $dropbox announced that
it plans to acquire docsen for 165
million dollars
the company helps customers share and
track documents by sending a secure link
instead of an attachment we're
announcing that we're acquiring
docs and to help us deliver an even
broader set of tools
for remote work and docsen helps
customers securely manage
and share their business critical
documents backed by
powerful engagement analytics said
$dropbox ceo
drew houston when combined with the
electronic signature capability of hello
sign
okay which $dropbox acquired in 2019 what
a business to acquire right before
like everybody starts having to e-sign
everything okay the acquisition gives
the company an
end-to-end document sharing workflow it
has been
missing $dropbox dachshund and hello sign
will be able to
further offer a full suite of self-serve
products to help our millions of
customers manage their entire critical
document workflows
and give more control over all aspects
of that houston explained
another brilliant acquisition in the
making here
for $dropbox in my opinion forward p of
18 is laughable
i mean it's it's almost painful i mean
it excites me
because i know the stock's going to 2x
3x 4x over the coming years
but it's just it's laughable literally
laughable at this stock trades at a ford
pf18 like just
ah just silly that's all i can say about
that
i you know as i was prepping this video
all i thought to myself is
i need to buy more $dropbox buy another
six figures of $dropbox jeremy
buy another when i watch this video back
jeremy
buy another six figures a $dropbox
immediately jeremy do you want to make
the money and do you want to
not to make the money okay i need to do
that asap now at this point i'm just
talking myself i'm not even talking to
you guys anymore okay
but the other day this is going to be a
multi-six figure gains
coming for me in $dropbox over time
alrighty guys let's get in the four
stock of these five stocks up here
and that is $upwork this might be the
most requested stalker certainly one of
the most requested stocks about you know
the fact that i haven't really talked
about this one recently it's a 45
stock it's climbed extensively recently
okay
$up work it was the perfect year to buy
this stock in 2020 okay
this was a five dollar to fifteen dollar
stock almost the entire
year in 2020 like the majority of the
year is between five dollars and fifteen
dollars
it was the perfect pickup i recognized
this and i picked up a lot of shares for
very very
dang cheap on this company but i didn't
pick up enough okay let me be completely
honest i should have picked up a lot
more okay
as of today i hold 37 000 worth of
$upwork stock in the public account and
then my main private account i hold
another 37 thousand dollars worth of
this
stock okay this company is beasting
clicking on all cylinders they went up
huge on their last earnings that was
reported very recently okay
look at these earnings almost shockingly
good okay
$upworker reported quarterly earnings of
six cents per share which
beat analyst's consensus estimate by 11
cents
by 11 cents okay you know how big of a
beat that is that's ridiculous
but that's not even the most impressive
part these next things are the most
impressive part okay
the company reported quarterly sales of
106.2 million dollars
which beat the analyst consensus
estimate of 97 million by
9.1 percent this is a 32.27 percent
increase in sales year over year
okay whoa we i mean some people had this
company thinking they're gonna go down
to five percent seven percent growth
and then they come in with a 32 revenue
growth number oh my gosh okay
the company also issued first quarter in
2021
sales guidance above
estimates that is great news okay
watershed year 2020 was a watershed year
for
$upwork in the fourth quarter we achieved
our highest year over year growth
since going public ceo hayden brown said
in a press release
phenomenal hayden i always believed in
you and you have come through in a
massive
way okay look at the growth expected for
this company in 2021
25 revenue growth expected next year in
22
they're expected to do 22.5 revenue
growth
this company should just grow massively
bigger over the next five
ten years the freelance economy it's not
shrinking
it's just getting bigger and bigger and
bigger and will
year after year after year $upwork is
pretty much the biggest player
in this market the end of the day if you
need freelance work whether you're a
small business mid-size business or even
a large corporation okay
you're likely going to one of these two
places these are the two main
$upwork and $fiverr $upwork and $fiverr
some people prefer one over the other i
feel like a lot of
you know more corporations prefer $upwork
some of small businesses prefer
more fiber it just depends but at the
end of the day you're pretty much going
to one of those two
if you're looking for any type of
freelance work and so the
opportunity here that tam for this
company long term is massive that's why
i bought in this stock
i love $upwork i just wish i bought
heavier
i just wish i bought heavier i didn't go
nearly heavy enough
in $upwork and i'm disappointed in myself
i just didn't you know that's another
reason i remember i was just talking
about
$dropbox i'm like buy another six figures
$dropbox jeremy
because i look at $up work and i'm like
everything i ever thought was going to
happen for that company is coming to
fruition
if everything's working out exactly how
i thought it was and stock's beasting
and i didn't go
heavy enough not even close to heavy
enough i should have bought six figures
in each one of those accounts
you know but it is what it is need to
say i'm doing great on it i love that
company for the long term okay
let's stock up here number five of five
for everyone that's been rocking with me
on the channels for a while this video i
put out 160 days ago okay
it's called this stock is about to 2x
fast
epic short squeeze coming i put that
video out on the main channel okay
and a lucky hundred and two thousand
people got to watch that video
and that video was on a stock named
$nordstrom
$jwn it was such a beating down dog stock
i saw a massive potential for this stock
it was being priced like they were
$macy's and $jc penney's and all the other
bankrupt retailers and i'm like
i understand this business model on a
very high level i'm like no they're not
okay
you can't put them in the same category
you put $jc pennies in $macy's it was a
joke
okay it was a complete joke his
management team at $nordstrom is
unbelievable and people have been
wondering like what am i doing with this
stock it's almost 38
you know this was a stock in the fall
time september october you could pick up
for 11 12
13 a share and it's you know tripled up
since then okay so as far as $nordstrom
this was never supposed to be a super
long-term investment for me
it's kind of just one of those plays it
was like you know when it reaches in the
30 to 40
range where i expected it was gonna go
well i really expected to go to 24.25
but i said you know basically if it goes
to 30 or above i'm
definitely going to consider profits and
i've taken a lot of my profits now on
$nordstrom stock where all these other
stocks i'm holding for long term
$nordstrom has limited long-term upside
potential so i've taken a lot of profits
taken most of the profits i hardly hold
any $nordstrom shares now at this point
in time okay
the only $nordstrom shares i still hold
are in the dividends only account
i hold about 71 000 worth of $nordstrom
in that particular account
and uh obviously the dividend only
account the the name of the game isn't
just like
share price appreciation but it's really
to hold these stocks and throw off you
know
those stocks to throw off dividends and
$nordstrom's gonna be a big dividend
payer
over time as far as the shares i think
it could potentially go to 50 or 60
dollars long term okay
and stock's been there before it's
definitely very possible
i was at a $nordstrom you know about what
was that a week ago two weekends ago
i've never seen a $nordstrom that busy in
my life at scottsdale fashion square
that place was crazy busy okay they're
putting up
numbers so i wouldn't be surprised if
the stock doesn't go back to maybe fifty
dollars or sixty dollars
what i can tell you is you know i don't
think it's growing much
past that long term and that's why i
wanted to take a lot of my profits
you know once this reached you know 30
35 or so and just hold in the dividend
account for this one i feel like most of
the huge upside is done in the stock i
think it
still has some potential upside but i
feel like you know it's squeezing out
the last bits now at this point i feel
like the massive move has already been
made you know the time to get in the
stock was back in the fall when i was
doing that video and this was like a you
know 10 11 12 13
stock now i feel like most upsides done
that's why i've cashed out
a lot of my shares and only hold those
71 thousand dollars worth of shares left
okay
but it's a great dividend stock hold the
way i look at this is if i'm holding the
stock it's not for the share price
appreciation anymore at this point it's
just for those dividends the stock will
likely throw off in future
years and $nordstrom has done very well
and i think it will continue to do us
very well on those shares i hold in the
dividends only
account hope you guys enjoyed this video
as always me touching on these five
stocks i know a lot of people always
want me to talk about my feelings on
them things like that
