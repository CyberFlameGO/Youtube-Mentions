oof i've got my passion fruit tea out
and i'm ready to go do not mess with
charlie when he has his passion fruit
okay so after another week that saw the
$s p 500 break into new
all-time highs as cnbc and goldman sachs
reports that investors are once again
increasing their risk appetite in
closing out shorts
as mr money printer powell himself says
the economy is about to grow much
quicker due to vaccinations and fiscal
support as bitcoin glorious bitcoin
hovers into that sixty thousand dollar
range
over the weekend and of course as dogs
run around without leashes
well with all of this especially the
dogs running around without leashes
you may be asking just what are the top
three stocks for this week charlie well
of course folks in this video we must
talk about the top three stocks for this
week but first i want to go ahead and
recap some of our plays from last week
okay so last week we talked about $crwd
$crowd strike this was our cyber security
play
and it continued its rally last week
look folks i know these runs aren't big
and flashy but these are some of the
biggest
plays for stabilizing your trading look
folks technology is simply going to be
taking over
more and more of our lives so you best
be betting that we need some damn
security with $crowdstrike we can profit
off it
okay next folks $mara lovely $mara
bitcoin miner $mara had a nice cool off
from all-time highs
and like i said earlier bitcoin had a
nice bounce over the weekend holding
above 60
000 fairly nicely and that's despite it
having that as a resistance level for
quite a long
time and that does suggest that $mara may
have a good start to the week
but bitcoin as a whole folks has been
uncomfortably stable
despite it having a history of either
trending up rapidly or down trending
rapidly
it's been in the same general area
basically since early march
that's likely because of institutional
adoptions and overall trust in bitcoin
growing higher
creating a strong resiliency and i think
that in the short term it's a bit of a
wash where bitcoin's going to go you
could definitely see another buying
opportunity with another dip in the next
couple of weeks
but we could also see some more
institutions adopt bitcoin and get more
rallying
just impossible to say at this point
bitcoin is basically doing something
that we've never seen it do before
be stable really difficult to see when
that trend is going to break in which
way that's going to be but over the long
term i expect bitcoin to really do well
and with that i would look at any dip in
bitcoin miner $mara
or in bitcoin itself as a huge buying
opportunity okay what else do we have to
talk about
pretty much recapped a lot on friday but
the other one i guess we should talk
about is $chargepoint
so $chargepoint last week we said if we
can get this under 25
this would be a good time to snap it up
especially since the biden
infrastructure program would be a
potential windfall
for ev charging stations but
unfortunately we just didn't get that
buying opportunity however we are
getting pretty close and if this hit 25
bucks or under this week i see that as a
pretty damn good deal
okay folks so that is it with the recaps
now it's time to get to work and the
only thing i ask of you in return is
that you go and drink a little bit of
tea
and then go and hit that ravishing like
button and also don't forget to

okay so let's get to work so first $$ride
aid so for context this was one of our
plays last year it got overbeaten down
on earnings
to ten dollars we said that that was
likely going to be a huge overreaction
we got made fun of for a few weeks
because it went down more but then it
ended up going all the way back to 32
bucks
lots of folks locked in profits on the
way up and had a damn great play
but now it is many months later and it's
trading back at twenty dollars
but the reason that $rite aid is relevant
right now is because they have earnings
coming out on thursday
and just two weeks ago they reported
bleak q4 data due to supply chain issues
caused by unfavorable weather
bad sales due to the fact that covent 19
safety measures have also led to a
reduction
of cough cold and flu cases and that's
caused them to not be so hot but here's
the thing
$rite aid has been selected as a provider
of the coveted vaccines in a majority of
states across the us
they've also been gaining revenue from a
rise in pharmacy sales robust
online performance and the expansion of
services to their customers which is
important because of course $rite aid has
a reputation of being old school but
here's the thing i hated $rite aid
pre-pandemic but the pandemic has forced
it to adapt to 21st century technology
in order to survive
at home delivery telehealth zero cost
for deliveries
all things that rydate needs to push
forward in 2021
and beyond and despite cold and flu
sales being pretty damn bad in fall 2020
that's just because of covet prevention
measures as the reopening continues and
covet 19 safety measures go down
dramatically people stop wearing masks
people stop washing their hands which
you should still wash your hands folks
but once all these safety measures go
away
well then we're going to see a lot of
traditional cold and flu cases start
booming again
and that means that that revenue stream
for $ride it is going to come booming
back and not to mention that those cold
and flu products happen to be the
biggest cash cows for $rite aid in the
first place
and while covet has provided its own
opportunities for stores like $rite aid
it also has drastically elevated
expenses for $rite aid so not exactly
something that riding needs to have and
as we leave the pandemic people are
going to be going to $rite aid getting
their vaccines and they're going to be
reminded
that hey rydeat is still a player for
your health care needs that being said
do i like it at 20 bucks well
i don't love it in fact the best outcome
that i want this week is $rydee getting
beat down a little bit more maybe their
earnings are bad and we get it be down
to 18 maybe 17
that would be the ideal entry point am i
being picky am i being cheap yeah i'm
being a little bit picky but i want this
cheap folks
a huge component of being a good trader
is just not overpaying for things
don't be too impatient folks okay next
the stock that you probably haven't
heard of before
$pltr so on april 14th which is this
wednesday
$palantir will be doing their doubleclick
demo event this will showcase how their
platform is used across
40 different industries and is the first
big publicity date for $palantir in
months
which is important because nothing has
really managed to budge their share
price in a while now of course a big
determiner of whether this actually has
an effect on $palantir share price
is whether it gets media coverage in the
past the media hasn't wanted to cover
$pltr
if the analysts start speculating and
putting out articles and media pieces
giving exposure to how $pltr
is working with so many different types
of companies you can expect a lot more
volume to flow to the stock
and we've seen that happen before but to
me of course the question isn't so much
is $pltr valuable but rather what is it
that's going to make the rest of the
market take note that it is indeed
valuable
and doubleclick can very well serve that
purpose if you've established yourself
in this play i would be patient if you
aren't already in it there's a
chance that this is the last opportunity
you have to get in in the below 25
range if you want to see my complete
breakdown of $pltr and the opportunity we
have this week go ahead and watch my
$palantir video i'll link to that below
okay next $baba babago sheep now this has
been an incredibly popular play of ours
in the past
we've had this as a dip buy on the
channel numerous times and it's given so
many opportunities to ride out its
uptrends and this has historically been
one of our most popular place to dip by
however it's been undervalued for months
this time they've been dealing with
china monopoly crackdowns
and the tech sell-off in february just
made it much worse for weeks and really
months
investors have been discouraged from
buying $baba pending the conclusion of
the chinese crackdown but now we have
finally had a conclusion so that's a
good step just a bit ago they announced
that china has finally concluded that
they will be finding them this amount
for anti-monopoly activity this is
amongst china's crackdown on a lot of
big tech companies
however again don't forget that alibaba
was kept down specifically because
people were scared they're scared of
what china was going to do to them
and over the next couple of days you are
going to hear how this fine is going to
destroy $alibaba as
of course the media tries to get their
clicks then after that people are going
to start realizing that this fine is the
equivalent of four percent of $alibaba's
sales
in china alone in 2019 or less than one
percent of its market cap
in fact alibaba has dropped over 30
percent over fears
of a crackdown a crackdown that resulted
in a fine that's less than one percent
of the market cap
and yes obviously the fact that $alibaba
can't expand into a lot of other sectors
is also a negative thing but still
$baba's going to follow the new
guidelines and while i'm not a fan of
chinese policies or the chinese
government
it is a huge mistake to discount plays
in such a big economy $alibaba is the
second largest company by market cap in
china and china is the second largest
economy in the world with a market cap
of 20.6 trillion estimated in 2024.
just a bit short of the us's 25.3
trillion in 2024.
now would i want to have over exposure
to chinese place
absolutely not but there's a lot of
opportunity in international markets and
i want to take advantage abugashi $baba
has delivered us many wins in the past
and will continue to deliver us wins
