hey guys what's going on welcome back to
another video if you guys are new here
my name is jj and in today's video we
have a classic
video of the channel we are going over
my top five
dividend paying stocks for passive
income in 2021 that i
am buying this year but first i do
quickly want to mention guys if you have
not already got your two free stocks
make sure you click the link down below
in the description sign up for weeble
fund your account with a hundred dollars
or more and you get two free stocks that
could be valued up to one thousand
fifty 850 that's free money guys why
would you not do it so like i said guys
this is $a throwback type video it's been
a while since i've talked a lot about
dividends but i'm excited to get back in
the game i'm excited
to be more you know dividend type
investing and showing the growth of my
dividends
and documenting that process here on the
channel to motivate not only myself
but to motivate you viewers out there
and let's grow these damn dividends
together we can do this let's make that
passive income guys for you newer
investors out there i do want to mention
this this is one thing i love about
dividends
is i always like to play out or somehow
do a
sort of scenario about what your
dividends can really do for you now
first and foremost i always say reinvest
your dividends
because that will compound your growth
of your portfolio
when you put that money that you earn
from dividends back into
the account back into your brokerage
account and buy either those stocks
based on a drip
which is a direct reinvestment plan of
your dividends goes right back into the
company that paid you those dividends
or you can invest in yourself but what i
like to say here is
is first and foremost my goal with
dividends is to become
financially free through dividends and
also the cash flow of
my real estate investments now one way i
like to kind of summarize this
is i like to compare things whenever i'm
earning dividends so for example my
birthday was yesterday
and i actually earned a nearly 50
dividend payout from
my $pepsi stock that i own in that
company and
the cool thing about this is that's 50
that guys i literally had no i had to do
nothing for that's free it's truly
passive income
is dividend payouts and one thing i like
to say is okay well what could i do with
that fifty dollars
well that covers one of my bills uh my
water bill is usually around my water
and sewer bill is usually around 50
bucks a month
so for one month that covered $pepsi's
dividend payouts
covered my water bill now am i
technically taking that money out right
now and paying the water bill with
no i'm not i'm putting that back into
the account and i'm reinvesting those
dividends
but it's cool to think about that so
it's kind of cool to always think about
okay well i could pay my $netflix you
know subscription with these dividend
payouts
i could pay you know maybe my car
payment if you guys have a car payment
whatever it may be it's always a fun way
to see that
that dividend payment grow but anyways
let's move into the meat and potatoes
of the video why you guys clicked on it
and let's talk about
the five dividend paying stocks that i'm
buying in 2021
for true passive income
let's do this baby
[Music]
so here is the robinhood portfolio guys
i am above that 20
000 mark which is awesome i'm trying to
grow this thing as fast as i can
and well it's not growing as fast as i'd
like but
i'll be honest with you i love seeing
these red days because there are a lot
of new stocks i have been buying
and buying into if you guys want to stay
up to date with what i buy real time
there is a link down below where you can
sign up for the discord and get
real-time updates when i am buying and
selling and doing options trades
whatever that may be
so for the first stock i don't actually
own it in my robinhood portfolio i own
it in other accounts
i do have other brokerage accounts on
top of robin hood
but the first stock i am talking about
in today's video is $a t
now guys i feel like every dividend
investor youtuber out there
has always in some sort of fashion made
a video on $a t because let's be honest
it's one of the most
popular dividend paying stocks because
of the high yield
that they pay now i'll say this if
at t had a lower dividend paying yield
and in return their stock grew a little
bit more i would still be
an investor in this company because i
like the things that they're making
now if i go back a couple years there
are some things going on some deals that
are made you know
the way they're handling finances wasn't
the greatest but there's
changes being made to this company and i
am
liking it guys with $att they've recently
did a
reorganization of directv uh they made a
deal with a firm i can't
remember the name off top of my head
right now but that is going to be a
different business uh setting it's not
in with $a t it's a
it's a different uh structure they have
set up for a direct fee so that's good
the ceo of $att has come out and stated
that they are working on cleaning up
their balance sheet working on the debt
because that's also
the first thing i hear every youtuber
talk about when they talk about $att
is the amount of debt this company has
if they can clean up the balance sheet a
little bit like they say they are
working on
this company i think does have a good
future moving forward
as well as the 5g space coming up they
got hbo max working for him very well
that they're trying to accommodate more
and gain more
subscribers from that streaming platform
so i like
exactly where $at t is heading now as far
as $att's dividend
right now they currently have a dividend
of six point eight nine percent at the
current share price $att is at
and they have a payout ratio of fifty
five percent guys
i'm going to be saying payout ratio a
lot in this video if you don't
understand what that is
quickly that is the amount of earnings
that this company
is paying out in dividends so $at t is
paying out 55
of their earnings uh to dividend
shareholders to shareholders for
dividends rather
so with that one thing i like to say is
you roughly like to see
a payout ratio of 60 or under i'm not
saying you can't buy dividend stocks
that i have a 60
or higher payout ratio i actually have a
few of them on today's list
you just have to look into it a little
bit more look at the business model
is are they doing the correct things
with their money and if you see that
being a true fit
then by all means go ahead and invest in
the company so
with that $att again meets that mark
under the 60
at being at 55 percent and i am looking
forward to seeing and gaining more of
this company
as we all know this is a big high
dividend payer and it will be nice to be
able to see them
kind of work on that balance sheet and
where these next few things go with $att
so the next stock on the list is a stock
i've talked about a lot whenever it
comes to dividends and that
is $3m guys $3m is one of those companies
is that you know they've been around for
a while but they are a stock
that is a very they make up a very uh
wide range of products you know the mask
they the post-it notes but they're not
just a post to no type company guys
guarantee you know a lot of a lot of
different supplies out there
not only to consumers like myself and
yourself but
also to uh offices and commercial you
know industries that they're they're
making commercials
products $3m just makes a wide variety of
different products
so with $3m they have a payout ratio of
63
so it's just above that 60 mark their
dividend payout currently with the share
price at 192 dollars is
3.1 percent so it's a pretty solid
dividend yield
and they also are a dividend king guys
$3m is a dividend king
meaning they have consecutively grown
their dividend
every single year for 50 years or more
there is a very few select stocks that
have made it on this dividend king list
and i actually have three of them that
are
dividend kings on today's list you'll
find out the other two here in a little
bit
so $3m is one of those companies where if
you sit on it hold it
you'll be collecting in some nice
dividend payments down the road so the
next stock on the list
is one of my favorite stocks that i own
currently and i do own them in
the robinhood portfolio you guys have
probably already guessed it
and that is $pepsi ticker symbol $p-e-p
i also like to call it pep nice little
pep in your step i don't know
that was dumb stupid dad joke anyways
guys $pepsi currently is trading at
141 now first and foremost guys $pepsi
when you buy into this stock you're not
really buying for major growth here
i buy them to $pepsi because they are a
solid business i feel very comfortable
owning this stock
and it's also a very diversified
business guys $pepsi is not just
a soft drink company they own many
different products
cheetos aquafina water bottles they have
a partnership with starbucks
they have many quicker oats the list
goes on and on for the types of products
that $pepsico is made up of so that's one
of the main reasons why i do love $pepsi
now they also do have a bit of a higher
payout ratio currently
it's at 78.2 percent but again this is
one of those companies
with what they're doing with their
current finances and where this company
is going
i feel no pressure whatsoever with them
still making that dividend pay out and
increasing that on that consecutive
basis as well
now i also do want to say this with
$pepsi if they would happen to have to
cut their dividend
this is still a stock i would continue
to buy i feel like a lot of people
when they talk about dividend stocks
they're only buying this a company
strictly for the dividend i don't do
that i buy companies because i
want to invest in that company and where
it's going over the next 10 20 years
and $pepsi is definitely one of those
businesses that i want to own
if for some reason let's hope not that
it doesn't happen but $pepsi had to cut
the dividend in half
to help get the business through some
tough times
to be able to reinvest more money back
into the business i see nothing wrong
with that again i don't
it's not the best thing to be able to be
cutting dividends and doing all that but
just in case that does happen
i am prepared with them having that
higher payout ratio
but let's hope they can look work on
that a little bit and get that payout
ratio down
to more of that 60 level in the years to
come now as i did mention earlier i said
i had
three stocks on the list that we will be
uh talking about that are dividend kings
that have been consecutively raising
their
stock for 50 plus years guys $pepsi is
almost one of those stocks
i think this is the 49th year so either
be this year or next year when they
will be considered a dividend king so
that would be a pretty exciting for
$pepsi and $pepsi shareholders
throughout so that is the third stock
and let's move on to the fourth one
another stock i have owned
for a very long time in other portfolios
and that
is $johnson johnson ticker symbol $j and j
now guys this j is the world's largest
and most diverse health care firm guys
they have three different main divisions
within $johnson johnson
they have the pharmaceutical division
the medical devices division
and the diagnostics and consumer
division so as you can see this is
almost
i like to call d j its own etf in the
healthcare industry
now again it's not technically an etf
because with an etf you have many
different stocks that you own under one
etf but with $johnson johnson and the
diversification of this company
i think $johnson johnson is a great
company to own they also have the
vaccine that they've recently come out
with
so there are some great prospects for
$johnson johnson moving forward now as
far as the details go they have a payout
ratio of 71.2 percent
again being a bit over that 60 level and
they have a dividend yield
of 2.5 and also $johnson johnson is
another one of those dividend kings
on today's list this is a stock that and
actually my sep ira
i buy every single month it's just one
of those stocks i dollar cost average in
i don't really care where the share
price is
i just want to build up a very solid
foundation and position
in the stock and this is one of the
stocks that i will continue to buy in
years to come
and keep adding to my position and
earning those dividends on a quarterly
basis now guys for the last stock
in today's video is one i am excited
about i actually recently just purchased
the first share today to be able to talk
about it on this video because i do like
talking about stocks
that i own and that i have in my own
portfolio now i did only buy one share
and i will be planning on buying more
down the road
it's just i bought it with the amount of
buying power i had in the
portfolio without transferring anything
over currently but i will be buying more
of the stock
now this stock on today's list that is
the final stock
is $garmin now guys $garmin produces gps
enabled hardware and software
for five verticals they do do it for
fitness outdoors
auto aviation and also marine so
$garmin is a well diversified in business
as well in the gps space
i'm pretty familiar with $garmin i've
used some of their products in the past
and i've actually uh know some people
that work at their headquarters
which is based in kansas city which is
where i used to live and i really like
where this company is going guys i think
this company still not only has
a good dividend which we'll talk about
in a second but it has some room to grow
in the years to come
there's going to be a lot of advances in
the gpa sp
gps space moving forward in the years to
come and i think $garmin's going to be
one of those players
in the space that can take advantage of
that technology growth
in the future in the coming years which
is another reason why i want to have
this
in my portfolio now the past year they
are up 81
in the past five years they're up a
whopping 235
uh 235 percent so as you can see there
is some growth that has happened with
this company
but with that they also are at a decent
valuation
right now they have a current p e ratio
of 25.3 percent
if you compare that to the industry
average of the gps space
it's about 55.3 percent and the s p
currently
pe is at percent so as we know 25.3 is
not the quite you know sexiest pe
you usually like usually like to see
something around the 15 level but in the
current space this market's in the the
crazy valuations we're seeing
i like $garmin here at the 130 share
price they also have some great margins
you like seeing margins on this company
because that's more money this
company can make to either one reinvest
back into the business
share buybacks and also dividend payouts
to yours truly
now as for the dividend goes guys $garmin
has a dividend payout of 2.1 percent
and a payout ratio of 46.3
so a very healthy dividend a very solid
dividend and they also have room to grow
this dividend as
well so i'm really liking liking $garmin
in the stock and i'm going to be
planning on buying a lot more of this
stock
down the road we'll probably have a more
in-depth uh video
uh kind of really doing a deep analysis
on $garmin down the road so stay tuned
