so we do the series every month on the
channel and this month i want to do it a
little bit differently i actually want
to jump from the computer this time to
share my information that i found more
easily with you guys to articulate why i
believe these three stocks are actually
really great buys today and i think it's
gonna help me provide
you know much more value much more
insight in these type of videos so i
hope you guys enjoy it now full
disclosure i own two out of three of
these stocks so
take your guesses let me know in the
comments down below which stocks you
think i
personally own and while you're down
there hit the like button share this
with a friend
subscribe to the channel and let's jump
into it so the first stock of the bunch
here in this video is $spotify
not to be mistaken with shopify $spotify
the popular
music streaming service this is a stock
that has
kind of gotten onto my radar recently
and i've been extremely
interested with all of its financials
fundamentals and kind of the future
prospects of this business here
so right now today the stock is sitting
30 some odd percent off of its highs and
i think
at a 50-ish billion dollar market cap
which is kind of where it's at today
this one is cheap i think this one has a
lot of runway to grow i think this one
has
massive potential ahead of it because
it's pretty much going after the global
market
for music and streaming so i think
there's just so much more for $spotify in
the future here
now when i go to like the shareholders
letter for example this is a company
that i see growing massively they have a
couple segments to their business right
they have their premium subscribers and
they have the ad supported subscribers
obviously the ad support subscribers are
not as loyal
if you'd say that of course they're
there to you know enjoy some music
but but their real income for $spotify
for this
is through ads the real bread and butter
is through the premium subscribers
these are the subscribers like myself
who are paying a
monthly fee to access $spotify's platform
to access their library of music and
podcasts and
possibly even some sort of video type
thing in the future and that's really
where this business makes a ton
of their money you can see here how
things are broken down right things are
growing
fairly well year over year for both
premium and
ad supported the idea of course is to
get people on the ad supported for free
try it out and then they love it so much
that they switch over to premium
that model's been working really well
for them so far the business is also
growing rapidly on many different
segments you can see here's
the monthly active users by region so
this is not just
a company that's just in the us or north
america they are big
all over the world and they just keep
growing all over the world which is why
i
love the opportunity here europe 35
monthly active north america 24 latin
america 22
rest of the world 19 and over time as
the rest of the world like
asia for example in africa you know once
things get
more stable there in terms of
infrastructure and
internet and 5g and that kind of stuff
expect this piece of the pie
to be one of the more dominant pieces
here
right now we can see europe is huge
because $spotify if you weren't familiar
is a european company
but also here in north america almost
everyone has access to $spotify
a lot of people use this on a daily
basis
for music or podcasts and i think that's
just going to keep growing the
subscriber base
and their you know loyalty with their
customers over time now there's a lot
more to read if you go
through their shareholder letter here
with $spotify but i'm not going to do
that in this video i'll probably
actually do a dedicated $spotify video at
some point
but just understand that this company is
growing and growing nicely so as of
today guys here's yahoo finance
this company is at a just over 50
billion almost 52 billion
our cap and if we look at what analysts
have
projected for this business they see
that this company is going to be growing
around 19
this year another 19 next year a very
very strong growth ahead close to that
20 that i look for with my stocks
i think that they'll actually be able to
surpass this probably hit like 11 and a
half billion or so this year
probably hit 13 and a half next year
maybe a bit more than that i think this
company
is being underestimated by wall street
and i think that's why i really like
what i see here
now you've been saying nick this is the
company that loses money why would you
want to invest in this company and
yeah that's true they do have negative
net income currently
however the real key here is their free
cash flow guys the free cash flow is a
very consistent
it's growing nicely expected to grow you
know astronomically in coming years and
i think this
this is really where investors are going
to recognize the company as a profit
machine over time
and start buying heavy into this i want
to share with you my
modeling a little bit of that for
$spotify here when it comes to kind of
the
revenue projections for this business
you can see here that you know i did a
48 billion dollar mark
cap estimate the last time i updated
this we can update this now to a 52
billion here which is what it's at the
day
roughly and we can see okay so if i buy
this company
today with revenue estimates growing
around 25
this year which i think is definitely
doable this company should hit
around you know 11.24 billion dollars
and a price of sales
of 4.6 if i stretch it out one year for
under 2022
i'm paying a 3.88 price of sales with a
projected growth rate of
only around 19 so this is fairly
conservative in my opinion i think
like i said they'll be able to smash
these numbers
but you know worst case scenario i'm
paying around a four to
five let's say for price to sales now if
i look historically
at $spotify here i can actually do this
on trading view itself
we scroll down here we can see that
historically this business has a price
of sales on
average you know in good times i would
say
of around a four you know like let's say
like a high threes four
in recent months it's been around you
know the five six seven range
i think is a little bit expensive now
it's come down for under 5.5
but on average around a four is what
seems to be reasonable here for $spotify
and if i look at the model again
i'm getting around a four-ish
for the end of this year so i'm paying
in other words around
one year out for $spotify if i buy the
stock
today to make the valuation somewhat
reasonable
for me now in terms of the actual charts
for $spotify here guys i think this one
is extremely oversold down 35 at its
lows we look at the weekly here we can
see the stock is trying to find some
support here at the 50 moving average on
the weekly
we didn't come down to this orange line
which i was kind of hoping we would but
you know we came close we didn't quite
get there and it looks like it's
sort of forming a base here a bottom if
you will and i think
you'll probably see a nice rally in the
stock in coming months here
because many people see this as hey
maybe it's a stay at home stock but guys
you want to listen to music wherever you
are you're at home you're out you're at
the gym you're at the park
friend's house you want to listen to
music and $spotify in my opinion
is that company to get things done now i
know there's a lot of talk about
competitors
and you know apple music eating their
lunch and all this stuff and
like i said i'll save that for a
dedicated $spotify video i have
pretty good rebuttals in my opinion for
that so i'm not going to really go
through that in this video but i just
want to cover this $spotify is the first
stock for this video
our second company is probably one you
guys have used their products before
not the most exciting but it is a $clorox
floor hawks
is definitely a you know simple business
to understand
they're here to help us with you know
disinfection and cleaning
and that kind of stuff it of course
helps with what we went through last
year what we're still going through this
year
so definitely a company that you know is
kind of critical to society in my
opinion whether
you know we get past all of this year
that's been going on
whether we're in just regular times we
still use their products regularly and i
think
now more than ever things like
disinfectant wipes that kind of stuff
are going to become the norm going
forward $clorox did have a phenomenal
year last year and right now the company
sits at around a 24 billion dollar mark
cap okay
so it's not a huge business it's not you
know one of those massive $proctor and
gamble $johnson johnson type businesses
but it has that sort of reputation in my
opinion that sort of
prestige in my opinion so you're getting
a good company here
at a pretty reasonable price at around
24 billion dollars
now analysts and they're okay here
they're seeing this company grow this
year around twelve percent
seven and a half billion but they expect
next year to be relatively
flat is that gonna happen i don't think
so guys i think
if anything spending for their products
is probably gonna pick up over time like
i said
and that's gonna result in my opinion of
some nice growth
next year as well stock market right now
is under pricing this analysts on wall
street are underpricing this
and it's an opportunity really for us to
come in take advantage and benefit from
a nice recovery this company of course
is extremely profitable
they're earning hand over fist here with
everything going on
if we look at their consistency here
this company has just been steadily
chugging along a profitable business
almost a billion dollars a year in
profit
and again it's something that's kind of
uh an essential in society because see
everything just
looks really strong for this company it
did kind of run up here with its price
to steals
in recent months thanks to everything in
2020 but now we're back to levels that
we were back in 2019 so you're buying
this stock here
with a good future ahead of it very
stable company you know it adds a ton of
stability to your portfolio
and diversifies you out of tech and
you're getting it at a fairly reasonable
valuation
and if you look at their price to free
cash flow you're getting it at you know
a bargain if you will here
another good thing about this business
is that they consistently buy back their
shares so
every year your shares are valued more
as they take them off the market
it's not a company that keeps diluting
shareholders you know a little bit here
and there but overall the trend
is down and guys the real kicker here
for this
is that they give you a nice dividend
they're currently paying a 2.3
dividend they have a 50 payout ratio
which is very sustainable they grow this
dividend
by seven and a half percent year over
year
and they've been paying a dividend for
19 years so they're getting very close
to aristocrat status and i think this
company is just going to be one of those
companies that
you know you wish you bought a long long
time ago
just because it's so consistent so safe
so stable
that you just wanted part of your
portfolio if you look at my dividend
yield history here this will really tell
you that hey
right now it's a little bit more
expensive than what it is historically
with around say around 2.4
yield but guys anything around two and a
half percent or so
it's a bargain for this business so
that's our second stock really guys
moving on to our third
$teledoc this one is definitely one
that got a huge boost because of last
year
and unlike $clorox which we'll just see
consistency now going forward
this one's actually going to see massive
growth going forward
because it's pretty much pulled forward
a lot of expectations
many many years in advance so you know
things were
shifting towards a more telehealth kind
of a world
probably by the end of this decade we
were expecting to be fairly good with
that
but now because of 2020 it's pretty much
a norm
today and this is just gonna keep
growing over time this has definitely
been a company that i've been watching
very very closely i know arkhanvest the
huge fan of this is one of their largest
positions actually in their portfolio
and after the recent dip this stock has
caught my attention
so if we go here and we look at $teledoc
we can see that this stock has come down
pretty close
to a very key support level on the
weekly it's come down to the 100 moving
average it looks like a double bottom
almost here
and this signifies around a 46
correction from its high the stock is
extremely oversold
it's showing me value and it's telling
me hey you want to buy into this company
this is probably the time we can see
here in the past it's had quite a few
levels where it's tested this orange
line we're pretty much there again we
may come a little below that to test it
properly
but this could be the bottom guys this
could be where the stock reverses
and starts shooting much much higher
this is another company that i want to
do a dedicated video on i
probably will at some point let me know
in the comments if you want to see that
because i think there's a lot of
interest around this and i think because
of its future
it's a company that we should not be
ignoring now if we look at what analysts
have to say about
$teledoc and see first off the company
size is around
27 28 billion dollars not a huge company
and with health becoming so important
health becoming kind of front and center
for the future
this should be 50 100 billion dollars
plus
at some point in the future i have no
doubt about that
we look at what analysts have to say
here with this on yeah
finance they expect this company to grow
81
this year and 31
next year absolutely astronomical growth
no signs of really you know becoming a
slow growth business this one is like
almost in hyper growth mode
and i really like what i see here i'm
also going to share with you my modeling
here with
$teledoc because i think this company is
also worth spending some time looking
into now historically this company has
been
around 813 prices sales this is kind of
what i've calculated
and with a mark cap around 26 billion
dollars which is what it was at you know
just a couple of days ago
this company was pretty much at what its
historical price of sales was rounded
13.
this means if i'm buying the stock today
i'm paying essentially
for this year's earnings and then
everything after that is gravy
next year looks like a ten eight six
five and it just keeps reducing
significantly
over here as you can see on this graph
so i'm getting some good good value from
looking at price of sales for this
company
i'm getting a real bargain here for a
high growth company and i've been
pretty conservative so over the next few
years i've
pretty much modeled out what you know
analysts are expecting
but then 2023 onwards i've just said
okay let's say it grows by 25
this of course is conservative for a
company growing this quick i think this
can probably do 30
plus for the next few years and that'll
pull down the valuation even further and
make this an even more attractive
business now $teledoc there are a couple
of red flags that you do need to know if
you're looking at this business
it's not a profitable company today it's
losing quite a bit of money actually but
it's growing at a rapid pace
they had a merger with another business
recently which is what's contributing to
a lot of
losses right now and if we just jump
over to their balance sheet here and
their financials
the one thing i want to point out was
their goodwill because of the
acquisition
that they made their goodwill shot up
massively
so typically this would be around you
know it was growing here 1.6 2.4
3.4 in total assets versus around you
know
one one and a half or so in liabilities
but now because of this massive goodwill
spike
things are a little bit skewed you are
paying you know for a business that has
a decent amount of cash on there a
decent amount of assets if you take out
the goodwill
but that is definitely still a risk to
consider because they do have a good
amount of long-term debt on their
balance sheet
so guys those were the three stocks for
april again let me know which two out of
three of these you think
i personally own myself i'm gonna read
every single comment down there so i
truly do appreciate you taking the time
to let me know but either way thank you
so much for watching and don't forget to
miss positively and i'll see you the
next one
peace
