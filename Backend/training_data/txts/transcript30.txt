update where we're giving you
everything you need to know before the
opening bell i am there
monday through friday so make sure to
head on over all right now this first
company we're going to take a look at is
one that i've actually spoken about
several times before since
last summer as a great growth stock and
that is
$teledoc they trade under the ticker $tdoc
and are currently priced at about 186
dollars per share
now they did see some great growth
especially december through to february
but then in february into march as most
of the market they have seen quite the
dip
in price now $teledoc is basically a
virtual health company
they get you the right care when you
need it most and you can talk to a
doctor
therapist or medical expert anywhere you
are by phone or video
they had over 10.6 million visits
delivered by $teledoc
health clinicians and therapists in 2020
and there's over 40
of fortune 500 companies using $teledoc
health
they have over 11 000 care locations as
of the fourth quarter in 2020 and
there's three and a half million visits
enabled by the $teledoc platform
solutions in 2020.
there's also 540 000 people with chronic
conditions that were served as of the
third quarter in 2020.
now of course 2020 was a huge year for
$teledoc
as the pandemic caused the demand for
at-home visits to skyrocket
but they do say that their 2020 bookings
position them for a strong 2021.
their bookings are up over 35
year-over-year with multi-product
bookings
being two-thirds of their new deals and
seeing an increased average deal size
on february 24th $teledoc presented their
fourth quarter and full year 2020
results
their fourth quarter revenue grew 145
year-over-year and their total visits
increased 139 percent
for the full year their revenue grew 98
year-over-year
and total visits 156
one notable person that is also buying
the dip in $teledoc
is kathy wood from arkanvest three funds
at woods arc investment management
expanded their stakes in $teledoc
seizing the dip on wednesday caused by
$amazon's move to offer its virtual
doctor visit system to other companies
$teledoc shares dipped 4.4 on wednesday
on the heel of this announcement
the pandemic has materially accelerated
the adoption of virtual care said
simon barnett who is an investment
research analyst with arc
he said it's like trying to put
toothpaste back in the tube it's not
something that's going to go back to
brick and mortar as the pandemic abates
covering the $teledoc stock for can
accord is five star analyst richard
close
he says that bright spots such as
multi-product sales
increasing utilization new registration
strength
and visit growth in non-infectious areas
trump the membership metric when all is
said and done
opportunities have presented themselves
in the past to jump into or accumulate
chairs of $teledoc
we believe that this is one of those
opportunities now there are currently
21 analysts with ratings on the $teledoc
stock
and it comes in as a moderate buy with
13 buy ratings and eight holds
the average price target is 255
for about a 37 potential upside

rbc capital who gave the stock a buy
with a 260 dollar price target
for just shy of a 40 potential upside

suisse with a 300
price tag for over a 60 potential upside
the second company that we're taking a
look at is $agnico eagle mines

1957.
its operating mines are located in
canada finland and mexico

earnings and cash flow in 2020 as a
whole

from 2020 to 2024
supported by record mineral reserve gold

up over the year
overall 2021 gold production is expected
to be split approximately 48
in the first half of the year and 52 in
the second half

2021 and 2023

completed in the fourth quarter of 2020
ahead of schedule
and their meleodyne phase 2 expansion
remains on track
they also have their amarook underground

and they're also in a strong financial
position as of december 31st
the company had strong liquidity with
403
million in cash and cash equivalents and
1.2 billion in
undrawn credit lines available one
analyst commenting on the stock is anita
sony from cibc
she said in our view the market reaction
on the back of quarterly earnings was
overdone and we would recommend
investors add to positions on the dip
we continue to favor $eggneco for its
track record of prudent capital
allocation
largely organic growth strategy
exploration expertise
project pipeline and strong management
currently there are 12
analysts with ratings on the $eggneco
mines stock
and it comes in as a strong buy based on

potential upside and last but certainly
not least we have

covering the $redfin stock for wed bush
is five star
analyst igol arunian he wrote a note on
$redfin titled by the dip there's a lot
to like here
he says the strength in the housing
market is continuing to drive material
benefits to $redfin
where it is having trouble keeping up
with demand customers
seeking service from agents was up 54
year-over-year
even after $redfin made changes to its
site that discouraged customers from
requesting tours when an agent was
unlikely to be available
he added that $redfin still doesn't have
nearly the amount of agents it needs for
the level of demand it is seeing
and they're hiring aggressively to get
there agent recruiting increased by 80
for lead agents in december and january
1st september october
$redfin is also seeing increasing repeat
rates and referrals which can support
growth for longer
$redfin has 10 current analyst ratings on
their stock
and it comes in as a moderate buy based
on four buy ratings and six holds
the average price target of eighty seven
dollars is about a twenty four
potential upside our lowest rating on

has a downside of about 20 percent

price tag for about a 54 potential
upside
