noon march 15th i'm just going to
send out the link so that we are able to
have more people
get some help right with the market
um just had an amazing amazing
share by somebody on twitter saying jane
you called that bounce
on the $spy so
we will check it out we'll look at that
today
are you having an amazing day today
let's see let's just open duplicate this
over here
sorry it takes a little bit of time for
me to get it tweeted out
so everyone can be here participate
today
i am going to have to be done by about
12 45
12 50. i will be on ticker talker at one
o'clock and then i'm on td ameritrade
at 1 30 today i need to actually just
double check that time frame so
let me head on over to
my email really quickly and just make
sure that
it is today
at 1 30 and i'm not going
crazy because it's supposed to be one so
it's all good
all right all right
let's see here
130 beautiful all right 130. so
everything is good let's mute this so
that i don't have anyone popping on the
background
and we are ready to
get into the market did were you guys
prepared for this drawdown this morning
talked about it a little bit yesterday
saying hey we could definitely pull back
and move to the downside today
were you guy$s prepared for all of that
to hap$pen
here we go and here we go
and let's get the $spy up over here hey
terry you are first today
you are first dana please uh please
please if you can explain dark pool
sell or buy print thanks hi phillip
mangia philippe
and walter good afternoon all right
so let's get into the
market right let's look at the $spy first
off
so we have our daily over here and
392 i said hey watch that level right if
you guys follow me on twitter
um in fact let's see this was really
cool
on the notifications today
so let me pull this up so i pulled this
up
i tweeted out hey guys $spy has a nice
little
island gap forming on the chart 392
support to watch
you called that $spy bounce off of 392
almost the $$penny i said we'll talk about
on the live stream come on over and join
me
let's see thumbs up are you here are you
here boss j
cross hopefully you are
all right so we went to 392.03
that's pretty cool isn't it huh now
that's just
studying the charts technically and
looking at it and saying hey they're
likely going to bounce it here
they're likely going to
take it and bounce it down and then
maybe fake out the gap right
and now we're up above the volume
weighted anchor price
from right here $sos traded over and over
all morning nice old salt trading
so i also have the volume weight uh this
turned on don't need that
so we're checking this out hey we came
down we hammered coming back up
let's turn on my other moving averages
see if we're about to hit the 50 oh look
at that
50 on the five minute chart let's check
out the 15 minute you see how it's
also rejecting the 50 on that five
minute chart well here we
are the 15 ema i know you guys said you
want that moving average video i'm going
to try to get that done today
as well as view app and anchored view
app and ipo video today
uh because it is going to be
great stuff for you guys to learn um
and we'll check out some of the other uh
potentially inflation related trades
that we could look at so the $spy we have
a double top if we go to the 45 minute
chart on the right
you're able to see hey double top oh my
goodness
hmm this looks like hey let's take it up
let's suck in shorts let's make
squeeze them make them sell to us and
then hey we
looks like if we break below 391
excuse me um 60 that that would be
where i would really say you know what
we're gonna go down we'll likely fill
the gap at some point this week
in my opinion that's what i'm looking
for is filling this gap
the computers do not like to have gaps
left open you can see over here
we had a gap right and then this day
boom
filled the gap right back up so how many
days was that
one two that was the third day so now
we're one two
this is the third day maybe we're going
to see end of day that we fill the gap
i also have some pictures to show you
guys so this week
four o'clock we have long-term purchases
that will be coming out
i don't know if you guys can see that
fairly well but let's see let's enlarge
it a little bit more
i can there we go okay and then tomorrow
tuesday we're going to have
announcements from 8 30 until 10 a.m
i'm gonna have to move this i can't show
you but then
wednesday 8 30 until two we do have fomc
meetings going on this week
so keep that in mind that it could be a
super crazy volatile week we just had
the white house come out and say oh
there's a potential
for inflation to hap$pen um
did you guys do you guys notice any
difference in the cost of your groceries
when you go to the grocery store
how will $$penn and $caesar joining the $s p
effect the $spy
soon uh it's going to de$pend donald on
the
proportions with with the with which
they are traded so what percentage
i don't know i haven't checked that out
but i could definitely get that for you
for tomorrow so
i'll look i'll add that to my notes for
tomorrow
for you guys for $$penn and
$caesar as well right
and we'll look at you you you i'm going
to try to zoom through everything
because we've got 20 minutes all right
so q's queues are green today
and they are testing this 21 ema on the
daily i prefer the 24 hour chart so
let's pull this on the 24 hour and 45
minute over here
so it seems like today a monday no
surprise
sideways day positioning day likely
going to be
kind of boring that's why i don't really
tend to trade much on a monday i tend to
watch more on a monday because we see a
lot of this
it just sort of goes sideways right
let's see last monday was the 8th
right where is the eighth oh eighth was
a pretty
pretty big day actually we had a lot of
volatility last week
and then now we're sort of slowing down
a little bit
and we're up at the top it's bounced
down
came up we're hitting this trend line
and it's slow it
makes me feel like the big guys are
positioning
today on the queues we're also hitting
that 425 ema we're hitting a
trendline resistance watching all of
that
to see hey if we we go up gasoline is up
and affects the price of all goods it is
up but let's go to cl the gas futures
right but it's not just gasoline
it's the inflation would drive up
consuming it consumer
goods right and when we look at the oil
futures hmm interesting look at that
trend line
what is this forward curve
i got something something to learn and
research now so when we look back at
this
i think we're going to have to look back
at the
three-month chart to see where that
trend line is coming from
yeah so this is a three month chart
from back in april of 08
to 2014. it looks as if it's
primed to break out to the upside right
biden did eliminate fracking and that
did drive the price up
pretty quickly right in three months
let's check the monthly chart
so that's where we are hey if we turn
around
and we come back and we close below
61.50
it's not going to look good for oil
we're likely going to be heading back
down to the downside
so yes walter i agree car cost is up
home stuff is up yeah everything the
price of everything is up that's called
inflation
it's not just the gas is up inflation
drives up commodities which is oil
inflation drives up gold and silver as
well let's check out gold
right let's look at $gc let's look at the
futures for gold
so the the futures if you don't
understand what the futures are the
futures are going to be contracts
that give the buyer the right
to take payment in the form of money or
physical product
at the time of expiration so right now
we have on this monthly chart we have a
crazy cup
and handle and we bounced off of the 21
ema on the monthly
chart right so we are still in an upward
trend on that monthly chart
russia plans on doubling oil production
there you go so it'll drop
right and if we can break out above
18 18 over here let's see let's put this
down here
and we have this right here so we broke
this trend line it pulled back
so it would look for a break above 1830
1800
is important but 1830 is really going to
be if we're able to do that this month
that big massive gold trade 700 points
to the upside
could really hap$pen fairly quickly
squeezing
right because we see this is the depth
is seven hundred dollars
and we could see that that 700 is
squeeze could hap$pen
let's also check out the silver futures
as well so silver futures have
definitely been manipulated
by the banks and on the monthly chart
look we came back down to this
upward trend line hey cool no big deal
looking for this to now i would like to
see this close above 26.87
and if we can break above 26.87 there's
a good chance that we'll be heading
right back up here
29 if we can break out above right here
28.65 another two dollars up
then we could really see this shoot up
shorting uh with some shorts or banks
that hedged really getting into it
what's interesting is we start to see
that
the volume is lower right now on the
futures contract
right hi kawakawa
so this buying silver down here buying
gold where we are
on the bottom of that trend in my
opinion it's not so bad
because this was in an upward trend gold
is still
when we looked at it still heading in
that downward trend i would wait for it
to break out
of that handle before getting into it um
but with inflation commodities tend to
go up when was the last time that we
really saw silver rise
okay when we went through the inflation
process from 2008 to 2011
and when we look at gold as well the
gold futures
well hopefully it'll give us the same
time frame yep so
when we look at it here we went from 700
to 1900. so silver more than tripled
gold didn't triple
about doubled right yeah we'll look at
you
you you you you you
austin i'll check it out all right so
keep that in mind right this was an
economic crisis in the u.s
what hap$pened what was that hedge trade
gold and silver let's check out oil as
well during that time frame
and see what hap$pened to oil
okay 2008
to 2011 so it dropped and then it
bounced
hey we had a drop and then we're
bouncing let's turn on some other moving
averages here i think we're above all
them but
okay look at that we hit one right here
this is our monthly chart and maybe
we're going to come back down
this is our 200 simple moving average at
70. if we can break above 70
long trade is on for oil in my opinion
amazing awesome
however if not we also have $fuel cell we
have blink we have $plug we have all
these electric
ev modes of transportation
but that's not the only use for oil oil
is also used in all sorts of things
even in the spray canister did you know
that that is propane
like in spray oil
i don't use it anymore i discovered that
that's propane no thank you i don't want
to spray
that on my cooking stuff anymore
check on lmt yep salt life we'll check
it out all right so let's get through my
list
super quickly let's check out $apple
today $apple is bouncing let's go to the
24 hour chart
still on watch for when we break out one
way or the other
in a bit of a sideways price action
right here been this way for quite a
while now
$microsoft yeah right that's enlightening
do you want to be eating propane with
all your food i mean we do if we
barbecue
right and you use a propane tank so
$microsoft
bounced up here looking for a break
above 237
or break down below 227 10 price point
if we break this
looking back down to 217 down here
$tesla having a bit of a bounce today
breaking the 700 level
would look $tesla to me needs to break
725 before he'd be confident
going long $amazon pulling back
right now $amazon on the big picture
not looking so pretty to me we have this
big
get rid of this here this is a 24-hour
chart we have this
big area up here where we're just going
sideways yes
this is a high of 33.60
and a low of 29.30
so we're looking at 700 points
so if we break down from here we're
looking at
2260 right roughly down here
if we break up okay back up there but
you can see that this has gone sideways
for a long period of time
there was a time back in december that
bezos said i could see $amazon going
bankrupt does he know something
maybe that's why he stepped down a ceo
um
so i don't usually trade the news
but i'm watching $amazon carefully
to see where we go from here this the
whole market feels like it's in
positioning
darvis i don't know darvis
what's darvis buy those with no
propellants
pauline you know the air pump ones you
can get the air pump one too and spray
put your own in all right so $pen $$pen
gaming today
had a big gap up all right it's not
showing the one that i did it on so over
here
all right let's go here let's go to the
24-hour chart over here so we are
pulling back
right here $pen gaming mgm was also on my
list today
mgm gapped up let's look at a 45-minute
chart we're
up above so we had a nice trade to the
upside and then pulled back
blink that green energy in relation to
oil dropping green energy is going up
we're also bouncing off of the 425
ema i like that it's holding that 425
ema
potentially as a longer term i also see
an inverted
head and shoulders right here do you
guys see that shoulder
head shoulder
aal as well aal
had a nice move to the upside called
this out with
angela miles on first business first am
and it surged up it's coming back to the
moving averages
potentially moved to the upside stimulus
money did pay
to the airlines to allow them to hire
b$lack employees many people would likely
be interested in traveling now that the
vaccines are out
$sndl $sundial growers
this has inverted head and shoulders as
well shoulder
head shoulder this is 93 cents to 150
i'd be looking for 210 to the upside
now it's breaking 150 so i'd look for it
to
head on up to 210 as a potential swing
target in my opinion
ing was breaking down this morning had
large volume to the downside had a short
trade
at about 11 30 from 11 90 excuse me
yeah 1190 just down to 1183 very small
trade
cnn came in this has been quite volatile
hey look we're going sideways right this
is about three days of price action
sideways up at the top we had some
sideways price action here
low volatility high volatility low
volatility
maybe high volatility discount
down to the 200 down here if it breaks
down i would look for 26.15
otherwise i'd measure from here 31.70
to 38 eight dollars
i'd look for 45 to the upside $riot today
bitcoin surged over the weekend not a
surprise
many times it does surge over the
weekend
also if you guys are liking the live
stream please hit that like button
subscribe and turn on the notifications
so you do know when i go live
i do my live streams at 12 15 monday
through friday eastern
when the market is open and then sundays
at 1 30.
so right now looking at $riot we are
let's look at it on the daily next to it
let's pull the 24 hour over here so
right now we came up and we're almost
hitting this trend line hey jane don't
forget to email me like yeah don't worry
self
got a bunch of stuff going on i'm on two
other live streams today and then i got
more work to get taken care of so i will
send it to you salvatore
yep we'll check $novak's and $lockheed
martin and you you
okay so $neo uh $riot excuse me is just
writing to the upside
i imagine bit w as well is probably
heading up today
uh down a dollar interesting i would
like this one if it could break out
right there we're at the precipice to
break out above 101 would likely have a
nice move to the upside
let's also check out $mara the three that
tend to trade hand in hand
to each other and $mara is up a nice five
percent as well today
watching that 44 24 area because that
was important in the past
with the dark pool so if we break above
that
game on likely gonna see bitcoin move up
higher
to the upside as well as $riot
as well as potentially ethereum feels
like a lot of people are getting into
the crypto space right now
all right let's continue $neo $neo bounced
off of the 21 ema
this looks like a discount dead cat
bounce
next wave down on elliott wave theory
also hitting that 425 you guys see it
now
from the bottom oh nice outside training
not my advice right it's not my advice
but that's who i use
i can't give you advice i am not a
yeah $btbt is just a minor though and
that's so energy
inefficient i don't really like $btbt
it's always lagging behind the other
ones that trade
and that's why i've decided not to
really highlight $btbt
all right so $draftkings had a crazy
volatile morning
drop down hey we regained some strength
but you can see that the resistance
right up here
right about 73 dollars if it's not able
to break 73 dollars
every time that it's hit here on the
daily it has sold off
so that's something to pay attention to
that if it's not able to break above 73
this could drop back down maybe we're
going to come back down here to the 66
area
or fill the gap to right here 66 66
right there
from the bottom of this candle a close
actually the close was 66.75 so 66.75
no worries all right so let's check out
$uu was the first one that you guys
wanted to look at
for use $energy fuels
is this a green energy stock
hello everyone welcome welcome if you
have any uh austin is this a green
energy stock
and this looks like it is low float hey
julio welcome
i was just talking about the the trading
community it's pretty cool
and uh people that we were missing
yesterday austin this is uranium
okay interesting and we have 130 million
so it's not that low float let's look at
it on the bigger picture over here
let's look at it on a monthly chart it
looks like it had that technical
breakout
right here that it broke out from five
dollars
and gapped up and now it's up yet 19
uh would likely see that this is going
to top out maybe about eight dollars
it'll
probably hit some resistance there
because that looks like that was pretty
strong in the past
and rare earth metals okay cool uh let's
check out
$lockheed martin really quickly
so $lockheed martin this is a monthly
let's put it back on a daily
you can see that i had a head and
shoulders up there for $lockheed martin
and sure enough
it has pulled back down a little bit of
a bounce right now
and bigger volume on this day right here
we're testing that high of that volume
uh let's do this let's move this right
here
you guys can see we're testing
resistance resistance
resistance hey nope they reverse it
right back down resistance resistance
resistance
so we have a bit of an ascending
triangle let's bring this over here
and this over here
so we have a bit of an ascending
triangle so i'd watch this for a close
really up above 350
is what i would like to see it close up
above personally that round number 10
mark or back down below 338.
so right now i'd be in a no trading zone
um
also the fact that we had such crazy
high volume this day
and we're testing that if it does not
close above that
potentially that was selling volume
right there
all right and let's look at
$btbt we looked at $novavax and vax
for pauline so $nvax is hitting the 20
simple moving average
pauline um and it if it breaks above 220
i would watch for it to test the 226 and
then fill this gap up here
to 238 so above 220 potentially up to
240
however if it's not able to close above
this 20 simple moving average
there's a good chance that it could
reverse and come back down here to 167
in my opinion right so let's do this
220 and then right here 202.
all right let's look at $mcdonald's
oops get an extra c sorry about that
guys
$mcdonald's i like it julio very nice so
this has slowly been breaking trend
lines and it's broken out today we have
clear skies up above let's see emas
what is this sma i can get rid of that i
don't need it
that's i think the 30 and the 70 so i'll
just hide that
so right here we have a long
consolidation
right i like it julio i like it
thanks for sharing so we have this
right if we're able to break up above
218.50
let's measure the depth right here we
have 205
to twelve dollars and fifty cents to the
upside
we'll call it so twelve fifty
i'd look for two twenty seven fifty
right up there
that would be my target um if it does
break out from that long period of
consolidation right there
now it could test that upper bound and
reverse back down
right but that would be my target would
be up there to 220 750.
all right we've got a couple more
minutes
fed this week is fed week yes i know
fed is i just i did go over the
announcements
so today feels like positioning day for
me we're going nowhere quickly on the
indexes
likely positioning day let's check g-nog
i think these are uh everything
monetizable
are these um wall street bets i heard
somebody else was saying that these are
wall street bet stocks
$golden nugget maybe this is in relation
to the other ones that are
moving in the casino gambling space
um you can see that it has had
resistance back here
in the past and that's also the 50
simple moving average roughly 18 dollars
so i'd watch it if i was in this
i would likely take some profit around
18 wait and see if it's able to break
out
then if it's able to break out hey then
likely going to move higher
you have 250 in your account tell me
what to invest i can't tell you chris
all i can do is educate you and you can
make the decisions
all right i'm not a financial advisor so
i cannot give you
financial advice all i can do is tell
you what i see in the charts
so $ebon looks like this is a spiker
looks as if it runs up to the uh 113
million it runs
up and then it quickly crashes down
right $lac is $lithium isn't it salvatore
i think
so seeing this we're coming up if if it
if if it looks like it held a top right
here
at 11.75
then it could head back down if it
breaks above and it holds above
we might see that this surge is up
higher
but it ran up to 1276 and then likely
selling yes
exactly julio one out of ten
that is going to appreciate in value
because it is a rare
car all right let's look at
[Applause]
$amc $amc has been on the move that's
another wall street bets one
also said that they are looking to have
um
they're looking to open up and move
forward into
new not new but reopening their theaters
so that it's going to include
more sales for them and squeezing some
shorts if we're able to close up above
1430 you can see that's pretty much
where we stopped 1437
then we're likely going to see a test up
here up at that 17
mark so this could still have another
three dollar
run in it for today we will see though
but keep it on watch and definitely
watch the 1873 level
this has run in the past
and this is from the downward trend uh
in the past so keep it all on watch
all right last one and then i'm going to
have to jump over
oh thank you julio for buying me a cup
of coffee
i have my green juice now i'm trying to
be healthy
i might be on something fun in june
might be filming something so
you know what old saw it wouldn't be a
bad idea trading rooms instead of arcade
rooms oh thank you tad
you guys rock thank you okay
so i'm going to have to end it for today
thank you guys i really appreciate that
um and let's check out
$lac really quickly so $lithium precious
metal
right metals are primed in my opinion
so so c3 a
i can it possibly go any lower good time
to jump on board
oh my my pleasure deya
so $lac if this could break up above
1820 i would like it in my opinion
as a long otherwise it could come back
down
a lot of charts are in this bounce and
drop
type setup so i'm cautious this week
especially with
um with
fomc on wednesday monday and tuesday
tend to be a little bit more of a watch
day for me watch days
when we have fomc and then after 2 30 2
o'clock 2 30 on wednesday
bigger trading opportunities in my
opinion all right see you all tomorrow
at 12 15. i'm jumping over to the ticker
talker
live stream come on join me there i will
be there
from 1 until 1 15 and then 1 30 on with
td ameritrade so have an amazing rest of
your afternoon
carpe profit sees those profits one
trade at a time and i will see you all
tomorrow or
