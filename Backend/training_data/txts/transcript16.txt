as
always today i get to share with you 13
stocks that i have a minimum of 150
000 in each okay these are my biggest of
my big positions i have in the stock
market these are the stocks
that i believe the most in for
the coming years and i'm going to tell
you a little bit about each one of these
talks we can't go super in depth about
each other one of these stocks obviously
is 13 stocks that'd be like a
four hour video and i just don't have
time to record a four hour video today
but i'm going to tell you a little bit
about my bold case on each of these
stocks so
hope you guys enjoy this as always as
far as thumbs up we're going for 22
222 thumbs up on this video if we hit
that
i'll tell you what i'll buy 22 222
dollars worth of $tesla master stock
next week okay i don't think we're gonna
hit that but man if we do
i'll gladly buy it i'll make a video
about it and everything all right and
also if you're looking to apply for my
private stock group that will be linked
in the description also have that as
maybe the pinned
comment down there if you're trying to
scale your portfolio to six figure seven
figures and beyond that is a great group
to join if you're looking to join
stockholm that's our discord chat it's
absolutely free to join in there and
yeah basically that will be linked in
the description as well already guys
let's get into this a first one of these
13 stocks up here that i have a minimum
of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars
in
is $beyond me okay tigger symbol $b y
n d and by the way this list is not like
smallest positions to biggest positions
or biggest positions to smallest
positions i just put it in a random
order so some of these stocks i might
have a few hundred thousand dollars in
some of these stocks i might have over
seven figures in okay so $beyond me right
now is about a nine billion dollar
market capitalization and this is the
the leading company when it comes to
plant-based meat products okay and
they're not just in the lead they're in
the lead by a
mile okay if you go to almost all
grocery stores they're now carrying
$beyond me
pretty much across the board and they're
doing deals with
everybody you want to do deals with
we're talking $mcdonald's
we're talking yum brands the biggest of
the big fast food chains restaurant
chains $beyond meat is working deals with
all those folks okay
the company's supposed to already be
profitable in 2022
and you know for a fast growth company
sometimes these companies don't reach
profitability for
you know quite a while because they're
just adding so many employees and so
many different costs of the business
at a giving time sales marketing teams
things like that and sometimes
profitability isn't the most realistic
but this company's already supposed to
hit
profitability next year okay as far as
current year here in 2021
companies supposed to have 44 revenue
growth and that is a huge
acceleration year over year and then the
following year they're supposed to have
47 to 48
revenue growth in 2022 which is another
re-acceleration of growth for $beyond
meat so
$beyond me there's no doubt the stock
trades rich okay there's no debating
that in the short term
but at the end of the day like where do
you think $beyond meat is in five or ten
years from now i mean this company
should be
massively bigger think about the
international opportunity for $beyond me
they're opening factories basically very
recently in
china china alone could be a market 2x
3x if not
4x the size of the united states long
term for that company and you just think
about the opportunity for this company
around the world
this company should be not just a
multi-billion dollar revenue company per
year but probably a 10 billion plus
dollar number
longer term so $beyond means got a very
bright future as long as they continue
to innovate
and continue to maintain their brand
they continue to working out deals they
just worked out a deal with pepsi
for distribution on a bunch of new snack
products in in different categories
recently this company makes deals all
over the place ethan brown is a game
changer they're a ceo
yeah $beyond me it's an attractive stock
uh for long-term investors
short term who knows man the stock could
go to a hundred dollars for all i know
in the short term or ninety dollars
but for long term investors i'm glad to
have you know a significant amount of my
money in that stock
next up here stock number two of 13 is
$dropbox ticker symbol $dbx on this one
it's a 23
stock here today 9.5 billion market cap
$dropbox is known as a cloud company
smart workspaces collaboration tools
things like that for like small
organizations mainly you know
organizations really with uh you know
100 employees or less then the company
also owns hello sign which is competing
in basically the e-signing and document
space we know docusign is going to win
that category long term that's something
we do know okay
however who's going to be the number two
player long term in that space i think
hello sign has a great
opportunity to be the number two player
in e-signing of documents
long-term and if that's true that's huge
okay the company
trades like insanely cheap okay it's
been trading anywhere between eight
billion dollar mark cap and a 10 billion
dollar mark cap recently
the ford p is 17 in this company keep in
mind this is a growth company
with virtually no customer concentration
recurring revenue streams
that continue to grow for this company
are always growing customer base for
them
it trades at a ford ps17 it's one of the
most disrespected stocks in the entire
stock market
keep in mind you know if i'm buying
$dropbox here today
i'm paying a lower valuation for this
company
then it was valued in 2014
okay that's ridiculous absolutely
ridiculous so
one thing is maybe they overpaid in 2014
paying 10 billion
in that private realm but also i think
this company's
insanely undervalued in 2014 it was
probably overvalued stock okay
and and nowadays i think it's very very
undervalued and that happens with stocks
sometimes i remember
you know $tesla was in a phase back in
2013 where that stock got insanely
overvalued like ridiculously overvalued
and then next thing you know it's 2018
2019 and the stock got insanely
undervalued and i see
something similar happened with $dropbox
where it was insanely overvalued
back in 2014 and nowadays it is insanely
undervalued in the market
long term will will will show its colors
through
and $dropbox will be a stock that 2x is
three x's or more for me
over time in my opinion stock number
three of 13 up here of these stocks
is the $fb $facebook okay so
easy money stock straight up i buy this
stock today
i'm probably doubling my money over the
next five years probably gonna more than
double my money and the chances i lose
money
is almost non-existent okay everything
is possible in this world when you're
talking about investing
but it's almost non-existent okay this
company is
like $dropbox just so disrespectful okay
it trades at a 4p of 22 which is
laughable literally laughable because
this company has massive growth ahead
look at this year ago eps ten dollars
and nine cents this year expected to do
11 33
they're probably gonna smash that number
okay next year
13.53 they'll probably smash that
as well all right i mean that's just
what $facebook does at the end of the day
they just smash these
numbers pretty much almost always as far
as current year revenue growth almost 25
expected and then close to 20 next year
and 22
as well but it's all about the story
with $facebook they've done a poor job
over time
explaining the company in terms of
getting investors really excited about
this stock because this stock should
trade at 2x to 3x evaluation today okay
not five years from now i'm talking
about today it should already be trading
at 2x to 3x evaluation but i feel like
the management team over there has never
done a great job of explaining things
but something exciting is happening that
i think is going to be the next game
changer for
$facebook stock overall and and get this
company to a place where it commands a
much much higher valuation because
people just continue to disrespect
the the unbelievable business model of
$facebook the platform
the messenger platform instagram
whatsapp and things like that
but where i think things are going to
change is you know virtual reality
virtual reality is the next big thing
right
and oculus is at the forefront of this
oculus is owned by $facebook
and the quest 2 is selling unbelievably
strongly and so i believe this company
is going to turn to a story
really around virtual reality in terms
of the growth and then $facebook and
instagram whatsapp those sorts of things
will be looked at really as like the the
cash flow machines for this company long
term
and oculus is really going to be the
major growth thing that people can be
excited about look at this okay
$facebook's other revenue which most of
it's coming from oculus okay
the revenue was up 156 percent
over last year and this is in the most
recent quarter so this is going to start
to turn into the
the real story of $facebook especially
when we're talking about if they start
doing a billion dollars plus a quarter
which is very realistic they can start
hitting that even this upcoming year
this is where the real story is going to
turn for $facebook
the company will start to command a much
much higher valuation than it has
previously being that they're going to
be in the forefront of virtual reality
technology which is going to be a
massive category and think about how
many different virtual reality products
oculus can launch over time if you think
it's just going to be video games long
term
i think you're mistaken there's gonna be
so much more there
there's even talk that maybe long term
maybe some sort of virtual reality
headset is actually what takes
the place of our phones okay so yeah
you know i i would just you know say
don't think
um short-sighted when it comes to
virtual reality really look at the long
game potential for
that business okay and that's really the
story there and
yeah it will be the biggest company in
the world no doubt market cap wise
within a few years in my opinion okay
number 413 stock up here is the $planet
okay so we go from
one of the biggest companies in the
world to a very small one 1.2 billion
dollar mark cap is
for the $plant and when you think about
the $planet they have
massive superstores they build they have
one in vegas and then they're going to
be opening one
out in santa ana area kind of in the
orange county area that one should be
opening a few months from now and those
places are epic
the owned brand opportunity in my
opinion is much bigger for this company
long term
than actually they're superstores and
then they have smaller store formats
that they're going to open more and more
of
and it seems like management teams
really interested in opening smaller
scale stores
that still can can drive incredible
volumes and still give a great
experience but maybe just aren't as epic
as something they're open in orange
county and something they have here
in vegas well actually i'm not even in
vegas right now i'm in arizona but like
the store
in vegas okay now the company has about
nine figures of cash right now okay
nine figures of cash and this is a small
this is a small company
they are so well capitalized to like
expand this business massively over the
coming years and
the question is they're already supposed
to be profitable in 2021.
the real question is how profitable are
we talking this is a company that earns
like
five cents 10 cents 15 cents a share
20 cents this year no i don't think
anybody really knows i don't think the
management team knows there's too many
moving parts with this business it's too
fast at growth right now
but they're already expected to be
profitable in 21 and that's amazing
for a company that is growing this fast
okay in 21 they're expected to grow
nearly a hundred percent
98 growth expected that's another number
that we just
you know no one really knows exactly
where that number's gonna shake out i
can see them posting anywhere
between 80 revenue growth and 120
revenue growth for this company in 2021
okay
a lot's going to depend on when that
store in orange county opens
and how fast it ramps also how does
business come back to vegas
i think in the summer vegas is going to
be busy
it might not be all the way back to
normal but i think this summer
you know i think vegas is going to be
busy busy busy again okay
and that store was doing numbers even
when vegas wasn't busy i can only
imagine
when vegas returns to big business so
yeah the $planet stock i
love that one stock number five at 13 up
here that's a major investment of mine
is $revolve ticker symbol $rv
lv it's a 46 dollar stock 3.3 billion
dollar mark cap on this one
e-commerce player especially when it
comes to apparel okay
that's the way you should think about it
average order size usually for this
company if i recall is around
300 so not like small amounts of money
and if you think about apparel sales
they're gonna come back insanely strong
in 2021 this was one of my reasons i got
in $nordstrom stock many many months ago
and that was like a 10 12
stock because i saw apparel seals coming
back extremely strong
it's gonna prove out i was at $nordstrom
this past weekend i've never seen a
$nordstrom that busy in my entire life
i just think clothing sales and apparel
sales in general are going to come back
stronger this year than maybe ever
literally in the history of clothing
sales it's going to be insane okay
company is expected to be profitable in
21 70 cents keep in mind this is a young
company
already be profitable with scaling is is
impressive 70 cents expected in 21
don't be surprised if they smash that as
far as next year goes 97 cents expected
don't be surprised if they smash that as
well
okay as far as revenue growth uh 18
expected for 21 i think that number is
low i think they could be
20 to 30 revenue growth in 21 for this
company
and 22 expected to do about 17 and a
half percent revenue growth so a very
strong growth company
it's a stock that i still gladly hold at
this particular time still a pretty
small
company i mean it's 3.3 billion market
cap and when you think about the
long-term opportunity for a company like
$revolve
it's pretty massive and you think about
how many you know old department stores
and things like that went out of
business this just the space has gotten
less competitive
over you know over the last several
years and $revolve was just in a really
good position they understand influencer
branding
companies pretty darn good at what they
do okay that's all i'll say about that
and i'm a big believer in a great
management team stock number six of 13
up here that is a stock that i have a
tremendous amount of money and there's a
$tesla okay
$tsla by the way 22 222 thumbs up or more
in this video and i'm gonna buy another
twenty two thousand two hundred and
twenty two dollars
worth this stock straining about six
hundred eighty nine dollars here today
661 billion dollar market cap uh $tesla i
mean you know yeah trades rich there's
no doubt about it okay there's no
debating whether $tesla trades rich or
not is that a 4p of about 175
and keep in mind some of that
profitability will come from basically
tax credits and things like that
but at the end of the day it's $tesla and
what do we know about $tesla we know this
company has
a decade plus of massive growth ahead
and that's what keeps me in the stock i
don't care if it trades at 175 4p
when it's a company that's a game
changer i'll just gladly continue to
hold the stock and that's exactly what i
do
to give you some reference we're up 1412
on those shares and i will continue to
be a holder of that stock last thing i
want to do a sell and take a massive
tax came there oh my gosh okay i mean
i'd have to pay
you know i don't know a hundred thousand
two hundred thousand of that money to
the irs i mean
i'll gladly just continue to hold $tesla
huge bright future in front of that
company for the next 10 years
and uh yeah i'll continue to hold that
stock long term elon musk there
ah just can't sell it man i love that
company
i was just fortunate to get on before a
lot of other people got on that one
and that's something i try to always do
with all my stocks like i like to
try to you know see these things out you
know try to look at my crystal ball
see where i think see things going over
time and then get in before
you know the the big money gets in the
hedge funds and the
big investment funds and etfs and things
like that and something we've been
fortunate enough to do on many of these
talks that
are in this video but obviously
especially $tesla that's just the biggest
proof case of that okay
stop number seven of 13 up here is
ticker symbol $wba
$walgreens boots alliance i do have seven
figures
in this stock in total okay about a 40
billion dollar mark cap
great turnaround play got an outstanding
ceo
incoming who's been ceo over at
$starbucks on $amazon board of directors
has been the ceo of $sam's club in the
past and
yeah she's just tremendous i think she's
going to do a great job there
$walgreens has an extremely low valuation
on this company
it's set up in a perfect position to
succeed in the future
obviously the the roni rhona shots
they're going to be one of the biggest
givers of those shots out there if not
the biggest in the united states
that's a huge opportunity for this
company to expand you know
basically not just from you know
standpoint of giving the shots but
really it's about
driving in-store traffic and brand
awareness around $walgreens and that's
what's huge there they're converting a
ton of their stores right now
to essentially i don't want to call it
like a doctor's office as well but in in
the back part of the store
they can basically do a lot of like
checkups and kind of almost like urgent
care type
things back there so yeah i mean you
know
it's a perfect turnaround play in my
opinion it's very similar to when i got
$nordstrom it's just obviously a much
bigger company
than when i got $nordstrom okay a
dividend yield of almost four percent so
i get four percent a year pretty much
just for holding this stock
and keep in mind my cost base is lower
so i think i get like 4.3 or 4.5
or something dividend yield so yeah i'll
gladly continue to hold these shares i
think they're going to appreciate
greatly over the coming years and i
think there's a good probability they
could even raise the dividend
in future years as well okay as far as a
conference call
and and their earnings announcement
things like that march 31st so it will
be this month and uh yeah i really think
the numbers are going to start hitting
big for $walgreens
the following quarter though the
following quarters where we'll start to
see
some of these big numbers start to roll
in in-store traffic roll in comp store
sales will start going crazy and things
like that so yeah i
gladly hold my seven figures worth of
$walgreens stock over the next several
years love that one okay stock number
eight of
13 up here there's a significant
investment of mine is $winning
resorts ticker symbol $w-y-n-n
okay 133 stock here day 15 billion
ish market cap and when it comes to $win
they make the best properties in the
world okay another finance youtuber was
out in vegas last weekend who i know
matthew and i you know i
had a show on the strip and i had to
show them like the difference in the
properties like a $win
property versus some of these other
companies i'm like okay let's walk
through some of these other properties
let's go walk through the harris and
some of these other properties and
$caesars palace and these other companies
and then we're going to walk into the
wind and you're going to just notice a
massive difference
sure enough he did okay i mean the $win
properties are the creme de la creme
if you got big money that's where you
stay if you like to
game a lot you like vip experience you
game
at the $win okay that's just name the
game they got huge properties in vegas
the win in the encore
they have uh two properties in the old
part of macau
when in encore over there and then they
have obviously $win palace it's on the
kotai
strip they have a property in boston i
mean if you were to build their
properties today
i mean you're looking for between the
land cost that has gone up
and and i'm talking like the
construction cost because everything you
know to construct those properties and
everything you have as far as the
materials inside have
have it all gone up substantially if you
were to try to replicate that plus you
gotta get the gaming licenses and the
teams and
it's impossible right but if you're
trying to replicate that
you're looking at i think you know based
upon my numbers
well over 20 billion dollars probably 25
billion
dollars if you don't know like the cost
of almost everything is going up i know
they keep saying there's no inflation
there's no inflation i don't know about
that okay
the $wind properties are magnificent
incredible structures
inside and outside and yeah you're not
building all these different properties
for under 20 billion i can tell you that
you're probably looking at 25 to
30 billion dollars a day
absolutely incredible stock number nine
of 13 up here of these stocks
and i have a pretty large investment in
this one i didn't put a lot of money
into but it's just gone up so dang much
okay it's a very good food company
ticker symbol $v-r-y-y-f
it went you know it grew into i think a
multi-hundred thousand dollar position
it's at about a 400 million mark cap
really small cap company one of my
smallest cap companies
i'm invested in revenue growth last
quarter of 322 percent
i mean this is one of the fastest growth
companies you will find out there
absolutely extraordinary
and uh yeah i look forward to seeing
their continuation of
growing their business especially in the
united states this year they're going to
start really growing in the united
states in a major way
and i look forward to kind of seeing
their product hopefully get on some
grocery stores shelves
over the next year or two and i continue
to expand that
over time all right start number 10 of
13
up here is $shopify so $shopify ticker
symbol $s-h-o-p
this one i put into the same category as
a test on my ass in terms of it
absolutely trades rich there's no doubt
about it the forward p is a hefty price
in the stock
however $shopify's business model is
incredibly profitable
it's going to be much more profitable
long term the company is a game changer
and innovator
in e-commerce uh and they're just going
to continue to expand rapidly over the
next five to 10 years in my opinion
this company is expected to grow
revenues about 40
in 2021 in about 30 in 2022
they're going to continue to grow and
grow and grow for years to go in the
future
and that's why i'm a proud shareholder
of $shopify even though it trades
at a you know really rich valuation
there's no doubt in my mind that this
will be one of the most important
one of the most important
tech companies in the world if not one
of the most important companies in the
world period
in 2030 and if it's going that place
it's going to trillion dollar mark cap
long term that's why i continue to hold
that one
and i'm a proud shareholder i hope it
goes under a thousand dollars at some
point in time
i would love that if it goes under a
thousand i'll be loading the boat on
that stock just flat out i'll
give me as many sugars as you can give
me i don't know if we would ever go down
there again under a thousand but if it
does man
i will be a happy buyer let's just put
it that way stock number 11
of 13 up here $ggtt f
can't talk about it but yeah it's sad
there i think i own
333 333 shares of that one
stock number 12 of 13 up here is
$tattooed
chef $ttcf i've been buying this one very
heavily
over the past few months i plan to
continue to 1.7 billion
mark cap game changer when it comes to
you know plant-based food products
specifically they're focusing around
frozen products right now i talked
really in depth about that one
in three stocks i'm buying march edition
okay so in that video there was two
stocks that were for sure stocks at i'm
gonna be buying and then i mentioned
three stocks that are probably buys
and $ttcf was one of those stocks
mentioned so if you want more bold
thesis
on that one check out that video in
stock number 13 of 13 the last one up
here is $corsair gaming
$c r s r so when i started buying very
recently i plan to continue to buy these
shares
very heavily as long as it's anywhere
around a three billion dollar market
especially if it goes into the twos
i will gladly continue to buy that one
and that was one of those five stocks
mentioned on yesterday's video as well

as those other stocks in that video
