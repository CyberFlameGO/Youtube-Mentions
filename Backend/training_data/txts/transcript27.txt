$gamestop is one of the most compelling
asymmetric opportunities in the market
today
really i understand how you disagree
with that that's why it's the top
position in my portfolio and also dr
mike berry's portfolio
but based on prevailing sentiment the
market and popular culture many think
it's a foolish investment but everyone's
wrong
it's like the big short again or more
like the big short squeeze this time
right
anyway let me show you what we're seeing
still in 2020 $gamestop maintains a
healthy market share within the gaming
industry
it's the only major brick and mortar
retailer dedicated to gaming in a recent
survey indicated that over 25 percent of
people buy their new games at $gamestop
and 40 percent of people buy their used
games there its reboot plan is well
underway and is comprised of two main
components
the first is optimizing the legacy
business by right sizing costs and
improving the omni-channel experience
this will boost near-term free cash flow
which in turn can be used to finance the
second more important component
reinventing itself is a premier gaming
hub within the thriving 150 billion
gaming industry game stops modernizing
stores partnering with vendors and
offering experiential products
this is the potential upside in its
enormous they've been testing four
stores in tulsa oklahoma that focus on
live experiential concepts
clearly the new management team is laser
focused on gaming and frank hamlin the
chief customer officer
wants $gamestop to become the cultural
center for gaming they also teamed up
with the dallas cowboys with the
$gamestop performance center
this space was uniquely designed to be
the premier facility for the next
evolution of esports
imagine a handful of these venues around
the world where gamers could come
together to train perform and just hang
out so could this new management team
actually pull off the transformation
it's possible they've been doing mostly
the right things over the past year
plus they have michael berry's support
you really going to question the guy who
gets his haircut at super cuts and
doesn't wear shoes
 i'm not but what about the death of
physical discs you say let me tell you
something
people have been saying this for a
decade and you know what $microsoft had
to say about this at the start of this
console cycle millions of people still
want disks
period it's a big reason these new
consoles have disk drives
and that's why physical will remain a
part of $microsoft's future to be sure
the shift to digital is happening
just not as quickly as many people think
it's true the pandemic may have
accelerated some long-term trends but as
stores are open and back up people are
buying physical disks again and a quick
reminder at this point $gamestop sells
other items besides physical disks
this helps drive traffic and wallawa to
offer exclusive console bundles to its
60 million rewards members this fall
that said the used games business has
driven the lion's share of historical
free cash flow so let's focus there we
know how $microsoft feels about physical
now let's check into $nintendo
and their latest pandemic grid and
quarter a whopping 44 of game sales were
still physical
and this is huge for $gamestop because
the switch has surged in popularity this
year
and i assume it's used games have as
well and in particular animal crossing
new horizons was 50
physical and after having sold over 20
million units in just a few months
that's not one of the top selling video
games of all time so how about $sony
during the same quarter 26 of full game
sales were still physical
now the year-over-year decline is
certainly notable but two things here
first as stores reopened and new
consoles roll out this figure will
likely bounce and stabilize for a few
years
in second even just a 26 physical share
is still meaningful considering $gamestop
generator over a billion dollars from
free cash flow in the early years of the
last cycle and also it's important to
remember this is not a zero sum game
from april to june video game spending
was up 30 year over year that's a
massive benefit to physical digital and
the whole damn industry
and that's why $sony and $nintendo have
been boosting their expected output this
year
more consoles and a much larger video
game lineup than the last cycle means
more software and accessory sales as
well and this is a boon to a specialized
gaming retailer like $gamestop who will
also benefit as the go-to destination
for folks trading in old consoles and
games as part of their upgrade to the
new consoles now obviously this thesis
is based largely on the fundamentals but
 $gamestop's chart is looking
increasingly compelling and this matters
because if the price breaks out
technical analysts won't even give a
 about the fundamentals will start
piling on to add to this $gamestop is by
far the most heavily shorted company in
the market
with short interest of around 100 of the
float 100
can you believe that the
combination of positive fundamental
developments a potentially massively
bullish chart
in an exorbitant short interest suggests
to me that an upward move could be
explosive
maybe what the hell do we know
you
