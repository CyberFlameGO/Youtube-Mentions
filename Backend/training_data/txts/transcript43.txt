ladies and gentlemen i got a banger or
video for you today we have so much to
cover
$palantir incredible news $tesla new price
target updates
we have more banks with their hand in
the cookie jar with the archaic's
capital more information coming out
we have $apple being downgraded and some
news about $teledog
that have been misrepresented in
mainstream media which i want to clarify
so
a lot of bangers hang tight and if this
is your first time here
the pace is a little bit fast as you can
see but it's good i don't need to click
nothing it's not smash nothing just
listen up
i just want your attention don't do
anything just listen
by the way my name is tom i used to be a
senior financial analyst
now i'm a full-time youtuber giving you
my knowledge about the stock market the
economics the financial world
all that good stuff just listen up don't
do anything now check this out
for the first story of the day we gotta
talk about $tesla
we have some incredible news coming out
with regards to $tesla now
as you remember redbush actually
upgraded their $tesla price target two
one thousand dollars a few days ago
including a thirteen hundred dollar
price target for the bulk case now
wet bush is a known bull on $tesla so no
huge surprises there
and this isn't the piece of news i'm
about to talk to in this video now
what i do want to point out in this
video is that sawyer merit put out on
his twitter feed
this now sawyer merit has been on the
channel before this is the second time
he's legit go follow the guy and
according to swear merit
this is what happened $morgan stanley
pulled out allegedly
this newsletter to their clients saying
and i'm quoting
we believe our investors face greater
risk not owning $tesla
and their portfolios rather than owning
$tesla shares in their portfolio
essentially what it means
it's much riskier not to get $tesla
shares these days
than actually getting it according to
$morgan stanley based on this tweet from
sawyer merit
i don't know if it's legit or not but
this guy seems legit so i tend to
believe it but again
we need some more confirmation now this
is huge because unlike what bush
$morgan stanley are not really well known
to be as a huge
$tesla bull and for them to make this
statement you have to understand that
this went through
a lot of cycles of approvals lawyers
risk officers
a lot of people had to sign off on them
saying that for them to say that
it means they have 150 confidence that
this is very accurate otherwise
they're gonna be in a world of pain if
this doesn't pan out and where do i
stand on this from 10
000 feet high very simply in two
sentences first of all
i think that a lot of investors
institutional and retail investors alike
are now gradually starting to understand
that $tesla
should have never been included in the
tech sell-off of
mid-february they have nothing to do
with the extremely speculative companies
that people
sold off they have a completely
different approach completely different
business model
and they're in such a stage that they're
pretty much about to take over
their entire industry now that is not a
bad thing because for me
it represents an opportunity to buy more
shares at a better price
which i'll be doing this week even more
but you gotta do you
durian research and all that stuff let's
move on to the second piece of news
and now let's talk about $palantir this
is incredible $palantir
according to this reddit post are now
being offered
a sole contract by the air force nuclear
weapon center
to provide data services essentially
what it means in simple english
is that the air force basically says
well we can ask for
proposals because literally there's no
company in the god damn universe
that can provide these services that is
why we directly offering this contract
only to $piloteer they're the only ones
who can do this job
if that reminds you things i've said in
the past few weeks
you're not mistaken because i've
literally been preaching this that
patent here
is the only competitor in this whole new
category which it created
nobody comes close and here's the cool
part the reddit post also includes a
link to the actual so-called proposal
i don't know how authentic that is i'm
not going to take responsibility
but if this thing is legit if it's
authentic oh my goodness
so check this out now this modification
will be executed via
limited sources justification in
accordance with whatever rule
the justification being only one source
is capable of providing the supplies of
services required at the level of
quality
required because the suppliers or the
services
are unique or highly specialized
oh my goodness if this thing is legit
this is pretty much the air force saying
well
the only company in the universe that
can provide us these data services
at that level of quality is $piloteer so
no use even asking for bids from other
companies
that proves every single thing we said
about $palantir
and that proves that all y'all day
traders day trader mentality people
shouting in my comments well $palantirs
downtown are completely short-sighted
and now let's talk about $apple and it
seems that even $apple is not immune from
mainstream media nonsense and googly goo
undefined
and the whole story is that $morgan
stanley reduced the target price
for this stock from 164 to 156
still staying at the same rating
essentially saying well it's not 164
it's 156. if you actually read the
entire report
which most of you won't do and i'm
assuming a lot of mainstream media
reporters won't do
you can actually see that in the report
they're saying pretty much the same
thing i said in my video from one month
ago you can go and check it out
that $apple is phasing out from hardware
to
services margins are gonna be better
growth is gonna be better
it's definitely trending towards
services and that's a good thing for
$apple
new growth engines for $apple are coming
and the only reason that they're
reducing this price
isn't because something fundamentally
has changed with $apple
no bad news in fact only good news but
because their competitors their peers
are trading at lower multiples
essentially ev2 ebitda ev2 sales
all that multiples that's why they think
that it should be priced a little bit
lower at 156.
and if you just take a look at tip ranks
right here i'm going to show you
something interesting by the way i've
been using tip ranks for about a year if
you're watching my videos you know i've
been using it in pretty much every
single video i do
if you want to subscribe and get their
premium package there's going to be an
affiliate link below you'll be
supporting the channel
and now i'm going to show you something
cool is $apple really in trouble
well not really let me show you so these
are the top analysts these are the five
star ones
as you can see every single one every
single one of them
actually has a buy rating with an upside
everyone thinks that this share is on
their price
undervalued does this mean that $apple is
a bad stock
does this mean that $apple is overvalued
does this mean that $morgan stanley
reducing from 164
to 156 mean anything no looking at that
is really important once you read the
headlines
if you just read the headlines you might
think well $apple's in trouble
$apple's downgraded no the entire
community is saying that $apple
is actually undervalued by a lot look at
these percentages
my target price for $apple is 170 them
going from 164 to 156
is pretty much meaningless it's fluff
who cares oh my goodness
it seems that $morgan stanley have pulled
a fast one on the entire market
of course i'm talking about the
archaic's capital meltdown aftermath
it seems that $morgan stanley wore the
party that actually
jumped the gun before this whole thing
panned out they had a gentleman's
agreement
reportedly accordingly allegedly with
these other banks to slowly sell
off without people noticing and instead
of following the gentleman's agreement
these guys have broken out of the pack
and actually screwed $credit swiss and
$goldman sachs
by selling 5 billion worth of shares on
the night before the block sales now
essentially this was the trigger once
they did it the other guys
rushed through the door and this whole
thing started so it seems that $morgan
stanley
actually pulled the fast one on $credit
twist and $goldman sachs
but that's not the only piece of news
look at who they sold it to i'm gonna
read you from this article
it seems that they sold it on march 25th
the night before the massive cell
securities and look at this they sold it
to a small group of hedge funds
now they actually made these hedge funds
think
look at this at a discount $morgan
stanley actually sold the lemon to these
hedge funds
making them think they're getting a
great deal they basically told them well
here's a camaro
at fifteen thousand dollars and these
guys are oh yeah what a great deal and
they open up the hud the next day and it
doesn't have an engine but
so do i think $morgan stanley will get
sued by these guys
i think some of these hedge funds might
i don't know might have a case against
$morgan stanley
if $morgan stanley knew material
information about this stock
and they should have told the buyer to
beware and they didn't they hit stuff
like for example the khmer not having an
engine the other party might be able to
sue you i don't know so we might see
some lawsuits
from these hedge funds according to what
i'm seeing here they might sue $morgan
stanley who knows
but this was one hell of a 4d chess move
for $morgan stanley to pull a fast one on
the entire market and now moving on to
another piece of news
proving how mainstream media is all
about the headlines the sensationalism
and not about the actual news
$teledoc starts q2 with 61 million of
insider selling oh my goodness
glenn tullman a director at $teledog
health has sold
61 million worth of company stock you
would think that this thing means that
glenn
thinks the company's trash him selling
these shares right now means he doesn't
have faith in the company
that means you should be selling too not
necessarily don't believe the
you read mainstream media
what happened here in mainstream media
is not telling you is that glenn had an
expiring option agreement that should
have expired
on april 30th within 23 days
if he doesn't exercise these options
within the next three weeks
they they go away but here's the kicker
when you exercise options you go out of
pocket you got to pay for the actual
execution of the options you buying
shares
so immediately he sold it off as planned
by the way nothing was surprising
everybody knew that this is a planned
move so essentially he exercised the
shares
he actually paid some money and
immediately sold the stock to cover his
out of pocket so whenever people talking
about insider selling
you got to be careful and see what the
real story is because i think here with
$teledoc
it's not the entire story you gotta look
at it with context
