funds now hit that like button
shout out to everybody that hit the
notification bell subscribe to the
channel
and the first banger on the list is
$charge point ticker symbol $c
h p t what i want you to do is hit that
patreon link so you could be up on the
plays as early as we are
we already up like 40 percent on $charge
point why
because we got in on 19. i've been
telling you pick it up pick it up pick
it up pick it up hit that patreon link
get in the discord with us baby stop
missing out on the plays
and hit the weevil link so when we get
to this next banger on the list
you can get in a pre market and go on
this run with us so now
let's talk about it the first banner
list again is $chargepoint and again
i've been telling you all week i've been
telling you all a month
$charge point it's in a 19 range scoop it
up scoop it up scoop it up
if you've been scooping it up let me
know in the comments because now
at a minimum if you've been rocking with
me you should be up either 50
on this or 40 on this or somewhere
around in that range you should be way
way up on this play so i want you to say
just major salute i appreciate you for
that we made some money together and we
gonna keep doing it this only the
beginning baby we going straight to the
promised land
i'll see you there now let's talk about
it your boy joe biden
he did this he came out with this 2
trillion dollar infrastructure just
playing
and we already know they trying to build
out all of this ev just
all of the ev infrastructure we knew
that $charge point was going to be one of
the main benefactors
of said information that's absolutely
important and absolutely pivotal
they're going to be one of the biggest
dogs in the game number two in the game
is not even close
in terms of infrastructure for the ev
charger network so we knew
that this thing was going to blow up and
joe biden at a minimum he won 500 000
charging devices
installed by 2030 keep in mind
$chargepoint
has about 73 of the whole infrastructure
for ev networks why is that important
because if there's tax incentives
on how to make just all of these
infrastructure devices
for charging networks guess what they
was already gonna do that
but now that there's tax incentives this
basically
increases the number at the bottom line
so their balance sheet they just got a
new tax incentive
huge tax incentive from the government
saying what you was already doing guess
what
we gonna give you tax incentives so you
can make more money
doing what you was already gonna do so
now $chargepoint could take the
difference
and then speed up and fast track what
they was already gonna do
and become a bigger company than they
was already planning to be
just for the sole factor being the right
company at the right time
now how we gonna play this one how we
gonna play this one just like this
we was doing it with the strike price i
see a price i like got straight but
now this one has graduated this one has
graduated to strike
to own a specific amount of shares you
want to try to get
about five thousand dollars worth of
this that don't mean today that don't
mean tomorrow
if you could do it today and tomorrow
listen you're gonna average in
however you want to get to about five
thousand dollars worth of this build out
your position
if you want to get more that's okay too
so we're gonna strike to
own a specific amount of shares of these
and then
but preferably i don't want you to just
rush it this one already ran up
so you're going to build your position
out for the rest of the year however
preferably you know how we do we
prepared not surprised
you want to pick this one up whether
it's in the 25
range preferably it may never come back
down there but you want to be prepared
not surprised
proper preparation prevents poor
performance say it with me again proper
preparation prevents poor performance
you want to be prepared not surprised
so you want to pick it up in a 25 range
preferably or lower
but if it keeps going up then we're just
gonna average up average up average up
this is a three year hold at a minimum
as long as you're going to hold $tesla
stock
or $neo stock or any of these ev stocks
$cciv
this company is going to benefit from
all of those companies
coming up in the world because they're
the plug it's like plugging something
into a wall they're literally a charging
station network
so then strike to own and then when we
get out of this one i told you three
years
if not as long as you hold on to your ev
play this is a ev
play now the next banger on the list
make sure i got your ear for this one
this might be the most
just popping one next week potentially
remember nobody got a crystal ball
the market could do whatever it wants in
the short term
but long term this one is a banger this
one is a banger
and we talked about this on friday so
again make sure i got your air on this
and the next banger on the list is $nano
x imaging ticker symbol $n
n o x now of all of the stocks on the
entire stock market
this one has the biggest catalyst that
it did not yet get to react to
and i talked about it on friday when the
news broke
however you know me i just don't have it
in my heart to leave you want to form
baby
so now let's bring it up again and let's
talk about it on friday at 11 a.m
they announced that they received the
fda clearance for their single source
x-ray imaging system now why is that
important in particular
if you want to see the whole breakdown
you go watch my friday video on it but
i'll break it down real quick right here
right now for you
why is that important because there was
previously a 94
plus stock but they got denied the fda
clearance and then it brought them all
the way back down to where they are now
people in anticipation of them getting
fda clearance
ran it all the way up like that to 90s
but now that they
got the clearance and this isn't even
the full clearance for their full
service this is the single source
x-ray service single source just
basically one x-ray
doing a scan but they got one where it's
many many of them doing a scan
getting a more detailed picture and
they're gonna put the application in for
that
but let's bring it back to the point and
the point is this they gave us this
information
they told us this catalyst when the
stock market was completely closed on
good friday
the stock market wasn't open meaning the
stock did not get to react to this yet
think about that the stock did not get
to react
to this fda clearance news and this
isn't just some random company
this is a company that has the potential
to actually and quite literally
change the world this is a
banger but again nobody got a crystal
ball you can't say for certain that it's
gonna run up on monday
but if any stock had the chance to this
is the banker that has the chance to
run up in the short term and then long
term when they get that multi-source
application going and get cleared for
that
because the single source working is
going to bring the multi-source an
opportunity to get cleared even faster
than it happened with the single source
so now let's just move on who is this
company for those who don't know
their medical systems company and
they're trying to bring
scanning just major scanning and medical
scanning
down to earth traditionally it's done in
big bulky machines and their machine has
a smaller footprint than the traditional
machines
and guess what else it's ten times
cheaper at a minimum
than all of the others so this has a
chance to bring scanning
to the entire world in a way that it
couldn't be done before so they got a
chance to quite literally change the
world baby
okay so what are wall street saying
about this one say it was a buy stock
analyst
one say it was a whole nobody said it
was a cell price target on this
was 67 we already seen it run up to 94
and this is before the fda clearance
before the fda clearance
okay how do we play this we're going to
play with the strike
price strike price and we're going to
put a third of our money
on each of the strike prices aka if i
see a price i like i strike say with me
again
if i see a price i like gotta strike and
if i don't
we pass on the play there will always be
another play so how do we do this
you got to be prepared that's how we do
it on this channel you got to be ready
for a stock to run up
but guess what stocks don't only go up
you got to be ready for a stock to come
down as well
what do i mean by that i mean this the
first
strike price is now right now the first
strike price is right now
you put a third of your money in the
game so you could go on the run if it
goes up
but guess what what if it go down this
is one of the values of the channel
i teach you how to not lose money if
it's high risk high reward we know how
to play it
so put a third of your money you don't
go all in like a crash that's dummy
driving into a wall without a plan
30 of money boom right now remember none
of this is financial advice you got to
do your own research
so now the next strike price is going to
be
38 38 a share so then
boom you put your next 30 money on that
if it came down a little bit
but you're going to put a stop loss a
dollar amount stop loss
at 37. if it come down from 37 it's
probably headed
to 30 a share now this one is likely to
take off on monday depending on how the
market is doing
but if it comes down you got to be
prepared for that too baby we prepared
not surprised
so you put a stop loss at 37 and it
kicks you out then you can buy back in
when it settles around the 30 dollar
range or so and then you ride a
slingshot straight to the promised land
baby
i see you there if you're gonna see me
there let me know in the comments baby
i'll see you there and then how long we
holding this one if it runs up
at a minimum you gotta hold this one for
a year and you can average up on this
because with this single source getting
fda clearance this adds a
load of legitimacy to the company
a load of legitimacy so now let's get to
our comment today
and the comedy day is for me and it's
about $churchill capital corp
so $churchill capital corp as soon as
they start
delivering vehicles and we start to see
that their battery pack
is what they say it was going to be just
a new game changing type of battery pack
guess what the stock is going to run but
for now with them talking about
just stereo systems and sound systems
and all of this in this factory
what we need them to do is get a car
delivered and they said that they're
going to get somewhere around 500
or 500 vehicles or units delivered this
year
we need to see it happen baby we need to
see it happen so
we still loading up on $cciv if you have
not already however
try to load up as close to 20 a share as
close to
that as you possibly can as soon as some
news drop of them delivering vehicles
this one is going to run
now many sources have said that this
company is going to be a hundred dollars
by 2024
but guess what they could have did it
way sooner than that if they didn't
botch the valuation
and they didn't botch this and that when
they did the announcement
but you know what you can't cry over
spilled milk from the day one we knew
this was high risk higher war
put your stop loss on it get kicked out
buy back in low but at a minimum
we average down on the play and get our
average as low as we can
so that we can ride to the promised land
baby i'll see you there if you guys see
me there let me know in the comments and
hit that patreon link so you can be up
on the plays as early as we are we try
to knock it out the park in the
pre-market hit that weibo link
other than that i love y'all but if you
can't handle the heat of these hot
stocks then stay out of the kitchen and
consider investing in
index funds take care
you
