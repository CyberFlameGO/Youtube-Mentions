what's up guys welcome back to my
channel if you're new here it says about
65
of you watching are new what are you
doing make sure to subscribe to my
channel we have a great time
talking about stocks investments and
things i'm doing
with my investment portfolio today i
have a really exciting
stock to talk about because this week
joe biden is set to
announce and push out his infrastructure
bill and he's supposed to break it up
into two different parts but this week
they're supposed to be the part for
infrastructure specifically for roads
and buildings and also
for clean energy and green energy and
climate change
so this in particular is in my opinion
going to really benefit a couple of
stocks
that we've gone over a lot on my channel
one is going to be
$mp materials i think this could really
help out $mp materials
but the other one which i think it's
going to have an even
major impact on is going to be $stpk $star
peak energy transition corp
and their merger with $stem inc so
i think this week joe biden his clean
energy
bill the one that's part of the
infrastructure plan is going to be huge
for clean energy and if we're talking
about clean energy
well then $stpk and $stem inc are
definitely companies that in my opinion
are going to do extremely well with this
announcement which is supposed to come
on
wednesday of this week which is going to
be wednesday
um i believe march 31st
and that is in my opinion gonna have a
really big impact on it
so according to fox news on sunday they
said that biden will unveil his first
part of
his infrastructure plan focused
specifically on items
like rebuilding roads rebuilding
railways
railways also be focused on fighting
climate change some of biden's advisors
believe that dividing the package into
two different parts originally it was
supposed to be
about a three trillion dollar bill for
infrastructure that's how much
they're planning on spending in total
but they believe that dividing it into
two different parts
one for roads and bridges and for clean
energy
and the other for um other parts
that can make it much easier for the
bill to actually get passed and get some
republican support
so my opinion i think
clean energy joe biden he's been pushing
for having
zero net carbon emissions also pushing
for having
electric buses and electric vehicles all
throughout the us
the only way to have net zero carbon
emissions
sustainable energy solar panels wind
energy only way you can have more
sustainable economy
and um you know sustainable energy is by
having
$star peak energy transition corp and
their technology
um which is athena and right now
their theme technology is an ai platform
that essentially tells
the energy systems when to use grid
energy versus when to use
battery powered energy versus when to
use solar panel or wind energy it
tells the system when to use different
systems depending on
like peak energy hours let's say more
energy has been used at a certain time
and they want to switch to using great
energy well then they could do that
if they want to switch because it's off
peak hours and they have energy stored
up in the system
when they can always switch to solar
panel and that is why
i think $stem inc is going to be huge and
especially with this green energy and
clean
energy build specifically $stem inc they
came out their twitter is stem
powered they came out the other day and
on their twitter they said advancements
in batteries along with an improved
regulatory environment
and more investment could make this
decade the roaring 20s for energy
storage
in addition to them they've also come
out
chamath who's a billionaire investor
he's also come out and said that the
energy storage market
is a multi-trillion dollar industry that
is going to make first of all he said
it's going to make the world's first
trillionaire
but also this specific industry he
believes is going to explode over the
next
decade so according to power magazine
they say that
it could be the roaring 20s for energy
storage and in their article they talk
about
how um they talk about how
energy storage be it from batteries
thermal systems
mechanical storage hydrogen production
any type of energy storage it doesn't
matter
what it is what it does they explain
that the need for storage is considered
paramount
to the electric electrification of
transportation
and other businesses and continued
growth in renewable energy so basically
what they're saying
is that analysts are saying the only way
we're going to see
more renewable energy resources and the
economy use
more sustainable energy is by having
some sort of way to store it
because it's no good to have solar
panels if
you only can use it let's say during the
day when it's sunny out you need to have
a way to store that energy
so you can use it at other times when
let's say the sun isn't out or wind when
it isn't windy
how can you store that energy and use it
at other times
and that is what they're saying is going
to be paramount moving forward
according to the founder and ceo
of salient energy which is a
canada-based zinc ion battery
manufacturer
they said that the industry is still in
its infancy infancy stage it's still
very early on
but with joe biden and the
administration pushing for more
sustainable resources they believe
that's going to explode this industry
over the next couple of years
and they explain how the increasing
favorable regulatory environment
for energy storage combined with the
evolution of business models
that are bringing more capital into the
space that means the 2020s will be a
breakout decade
for the energy storage sector so right
now
they say we already are seeing companies
like $amazon $walmart
um and other major corporations saying
they want to be
you know net zero carbon emission
companies or they want to use
more sustainable resources all those
companies already have deals
with $stem inc and their athena
technology
so in my opinion i think moving forward
this week is going to be a very big week
we'll have to wait and see what exactly
is in joe biden's plan but i think it
could cause
um $stpk their stock and their merger
with
$stem inc could cause this stock to
skyrocket very very soon i think we'll
easily see this stock reach a hundred
dollars per share
over the next couple of years we could
see it by the end of this year even
um they're projecting forex revenue
growth for 2020
and they're projecting to reach about
one billion dollars in revenue
by 2025. so
this company is doing extremely well and
with regulations and whatever the
government passes with this bill
could really really make this company
have a major
breakout year and i think this is gonna
be something very important to keep an
eye out on and i think it could be
something that you're definitely gonna
want to
um check out and let me know if you guys
like the company
$stpk i talk about it a lot i love this
company
i love $stem inc their technology with
athena their ai platform
but let me know what you guys think i
think this is gonna be a really big week
wednesday you're gonna have to keep an
eye out on what is in this
infrastructure bill but i hope you guys
