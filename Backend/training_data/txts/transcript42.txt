that i think
are going to go through the roof over
the next year but it's my youtube
viewers choice selection so i'm going to
give you five and see which ones you
want to buy
i'm even throwing a triple leverage play
in there to see if that entices some
people out there for some additional
risk
so stick around i think you're gonna
like what i got for you

discord with thousands of members
i'm in there every day it's good stuff
and it's a good way to support the
channel now
we're going to get into today's action i
want to talk about the
the best stocks to buy today and take
advantage of what we have now these are
five different stocks i wanted to go
with something a little bit different
i wanted to go with five stocks that i
put out there before
that did not get voted in they're most
of these were number two
so every week i tried to throw five new
stocks out these are five stocks that
finished second
or around there through the the weeks
and anyways
i think they have some interesting uh
qualities to them but i wanted to see
if you would go with the triple levers
now i have on the screen as you can see
the five stocks $alibaba $shopify $square
triple leverage udo i think this is
going to do great i have this already
in my personal portfolios but i'd be
interested to see if
the leverage play entices some people or
$apple surprisingly enough i do think
$apple's going to get about 20 to 25
this year 20 to 25 next year so i'll be
curious to see if you go with the growth
or
what you're gonna do and so you can see
right now there's zero votes because i
haven't updated it
but we'll do that before the end of this
video and see what is chosen first stock
$alibaba i want to go over the six month
and tip ranks to show you
what the analysts think what is the
prediction for a 12 month price target
based on all the analysts together
as well as some other things now what i
like about $alibaba
they're huge they're massive all right
they're all over the world they're
they're continuing to grow
but if you look at this stock it has
dropped tremendously since then
we go all the way out you can see this
stock is $down like 30 roughly 30 percent
telling me that you know a lot of people
run away when you see stocks dropping
like this
sometimes it's a good idea to say okay
look i know it's trying to like catching
a falling knife
it did bounce up a little bit we went
$down and retest those lows
and i like where we're at right now and
so i'm willing to throw that out there
and see if somebody
agrees with the if the community agrees
with me or
if they want even more risk for me i
think this stock has some very
big upside potential at least 50 percent
in the next two years if not only a year
so we will sing
$shopify of course you know this is a big
one
arc is in this kathy wood likes this one
a lot of analysts like it you can see
the upward trend here it did come back
$down when
the entire market came back $down it was
doing very well
but i do think that $shopify is going to
have another run
very soon i think middle of q2 through
the rest of this year
should be fantastic for the stock market
it is 2022 that i'm more concerned about
and even then
i'm not sure i want to see what the
fed's going to do in the governments and
around the world and everything else
you know they're not going to let these
things crash no matter what they're
going to do everything they can throw
the kitchen sink at it
and make sure us investors are okay now
we can see where it's at though
this one looks a little bit more even
keel if you will look at this nice
flat it's okay we'll talk a little bit
more about this the next one $square you
know i love my
my financial stocks if you will and the
fact that $square has done so well and it
is very similar kind of
going sideways here but i do think that
these are going to bust out
over like i said middle q2 through the
rest this year i see an upside of 10 to
20 percent for a lot of these stocks
if not more depending on the reception
they
get next one ah i love this one look at
this
triple leveraged etf mo what are you
doing you're going to hold this for the
rest of the year
it has decay there's high risk you could
lose it all
and that's why i'm putting it out there
and see i already have one in the
i have $soxul which was the semiconductor
triple leverage
etf i like $udao i think a lot of money
is rotating to the $dow
i already have quite a bit of it in my
leverage etf which i did a video on just
uh
i think last week showing you the update
on that it's up over 32
i made 32 000 on that since july or
january 1st
and that's the one that's the highest
risk portfolio i got
even more than the penny stock so it's
really if you want to see these come on
over the patreon i have them all over
there you can see what i'm doing
now this one i'll be interested uh
because if you actually go back to when
we started go out here you will see this
is up 174
in the last year talk about gains
now remember though at one point you
would have been up
and you would have lost about 25 and it
looks to be about the worst of this and
i do think this stock's going to move
up higher from here and we will wait and
see but i do think this is going to
rally so i'm hoping
personally and i haven't looked at this
yet i'm hoping this is the one it's
picked
but if it's going to be a stock out of
these four
i like all four so i think $apple would
be the safer one
but i think $square of $shopify would be
pretty interesting too i think $alibaba
and $apple are kind of the safer too so
we'll see if we go
a risky individual a triple leveraged or
we'll go into $apple which i've talked
about $apple you can see this is kind of
sideways went $down
but now you got stimulus checks going
out you got tax
refunds coming back in these are perfect
for what i think $apple is going to have
for us moving forward in terms of
hardware
hardware being sold in their
subscription programs
and now they're talking about evs and
stuff i like $apple for the long term i
even added that long-term uh
leap on that option the $apple option i
put out there for two years out so
now let's go over to tip rings i love
this i do have a link $down in the
description for this highly recommend it
they got everything from
analysts that's the one i like the most
but they do have the hedge funds who are
buying news
insiders bloggers investors charts
earnings dividends
you name it it's all right here check it
out so if we take a look at $alibaba just
quickly 44.49
upside potential so we know that's good
you know when i do this
i am looking for at least around 20 of
or above
and that you can see that $shopify big
price
but it still has almost 18 and a half
percent upside potential so it's close
to my 20
and then $square only 6.78 so
i'm actually kind of hoping that this
one does not get picked but i do feel
good that it will
move higher but i think this is a little
off i thought it was going to be up
around 3 30 myself
thus giving it uh roughly about 30 25 to
30
upside so to me it still has that not
everybody agrees $apple 16.18 i actually
think this is going to
be up about 20 to 25 this year from here
and we will see so there are my updates
but
now we get to have the fun the fun is
going back
and seeing what everyone thinks is going
to be the best stock so we're going to
click in here
and we're going to update this to see
which one it is i don't know like i said
i hope you go with triple leverage
if i had to go outside of that i would
say oh
probably oh i'm gonna guess $shopify
would be a good one but
we will see let's just update it and get
past all this here we go
and at the end of the day we have
oh $apple nice you're going to go with
the more secure
and it's 34 to 36 this is anybody's ball
game at this point
there's only two percentage points
between these so
no one wanted you triple leveraged etf
of the $dow
surprisingly that's the one i would have
went with now and now we have $apple
straight up
versus $square straight up and go figure
the one with the lowest possible uh
predictions moving forward
is tied for second or right there in
second with
$apple just a little bit ahead so we will
see this has
5 000 votes in and so that two percent
of that is about 100 votes so $apple's
probably up about 100 votes on this
not even so it's going to be interesting
to see if $apple can pull it out i do
like $apple i think $apple will do well
moving forward
i'm not going to lie to you i'm shocked
this is a standard
big company i do love $apple but the fact
that $apple is winning this
shows you and i even had it last on here
usually get a little bit of votes up
front because they're number one
i have this $down but they're number one
they're they're leading this that shows
you the support that
$apple has i absolutely agree with you
remember i added the option i only own
three options right now
i have a $neo option $cci $cciv option
and i have an $apple option now the $neo
and $apple option
are both doing great for those that
didn't watch my video on the options i
had the $apple option i only owned it for
like a day or two it's already up 10
i think it like yesterday i got it so
it's up 10 almost
in one day so we are doing well with the
leafs i bought
and they're secure i got over two years
two months before they expire so i'm
feeling good
so i agree with it and i like it so if
you haven't done it yet do me a favor
look $down hit that uh weeble get those
two free stocks it take five minutes
this weekend

put 100 in there

eighteen hundred and fifty dollars
