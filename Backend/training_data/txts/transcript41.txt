what's up good people how you doing
welcome back to stock up with larry
jones we're going to discuss some stock
the president will soon be laying out
his infrastructure bill
and it is going to affect the stock
market
and it's going to affect a lot of the
stock that you guys are in
all right and that i'm in definitely um
i bought some stock
two two days ago uh monday night
on my weeble app because it was
aftermarket and i'm gonna
share a snapshot with that with you guys
that's really not my thing
sharing my portfolio like a lot of other
guys do that's cool
i'm going to share with you because i
want to show you what's happening okay
and so what's going to happen is well
let's let's discuss this real quick
in the past previous administrations
have
tried to do an infrastructure bill and
it never really
take taking off one of the main reasons
is
the technology wasn't up to par
with the bills right the tech the bills
were ahead
now it's the other way around the
technology not only is it available but
it is alive and well
and it's ahead of the bills and so
this time it's different i believe
remember i'm not your financial advisor
and neither do i play one on tv but you
must do your own due diligence okay but
i want to tell you guys
that there is money to be made um
right now and i'm going to suggest that
you guys
go long term and look at some
long-term stock especially with
infrastructure infrastructure you're
talking about
years and you're talking about good
growth
stock let's discuss a few right now
um let's let's discuss the long
low-hanging fruit
$tesla $cci veal $lucid motors
and $neo those are all ev stocks electric
vehicles that's what ev stands for for
those of you that's new
these three stocks will be affected by
this bill
they're already affected by the bill and
the president hasn't even
spoken yet and i'm going to add a fourth
one to that
uh $aapl $apple uh
because i believe $apple car is coming so
when do you get into this play
not when they make the announcement you
get into it now
where it's been beaten down and you
start adding to your positions over a
period of time
and for those of you that's following my
five dollar a day million dollar cup of
coffee challenge
$apple is in there okay so $tesla
$cciv $neo and $apple we want to look at
these
and if you think it's too late to get in
it's not all right so uh let me cut in
right here
this is my portfolio
on my weeble app right i
bought these monday night
uh um in chicago time about
6 30. all right so after the market
closed that's what the weeble
app allows you to do there's a link
below click the link
download the app get two free stock
worth up to eighteen hundred and fifty
dollars
i am part of a part of their affiliate
program
but i love this app because it
absolutely makes me more money
it doesn't matter if you have two or
three other brokerages already
all right download the weibo app and do
yourself a favor you'll thank me later
all right so let's keep it moving
so what else is going to be affected
charging stations and here are some of
the ones i want you to look at that i'm
bullish on
$chpt $charge point as you you saw in my
uh portfolio
in two days i'm up uh $fuel cell $f
c e l uh $plug
$p l u g and $blink $blnk
those are up already they're green
already and if you
think that it's too late they're already
up you're so
so so so wrong these
are long-term plays all of these stock
that i'm talking to you about
you should consider keeping these from
three to five years
and even if you didn't there's money to
be made for instance
my portfolio that i'm showing you on my
weeble
these are secondary purchases i have all
of these stock
that i've bought many months ago uh
um um in a bigger portfolio
i could literally sell these take the
profit and go
right but i also have the same stock
long term
so listen good people we have to we have
to make
long-term investing sexy again we've
we've
we're trying to be johnny day trader and
this is not
the atmosphere for that right so let's
look at a few more
things that i think that you should be
looking at i think you should be looking
at steel companies
so i want you guys to do your research
if the infrastructure
bill gets passed our roads bridges
are in horrible condition we should be
looking at
steel and we should be looking at
concrete
companies so i got i want you guys to
leave me a comment after you do your
research
leave me a comment we know about the
low-hanging fruit the $tesla's in the in
the $charge points
but let's look at steel and let's look
at concrete companies
that are publicly traded good people and
i'm telling you
an infrastructure bill it's like the
roaring 20s
it's there is a lot of uh uh jobs that's
going to be created
and now it's just not all green and
everything is fine there's going to be a
fight
and then the president of course is
going to tax corporations which
the stock market does not like and i
don't like it either
and so it's not just a lay down
everything is fine
let's start printing money though i do
see greener paths
we're over q1 right now and i've been
telling you guys since
last year q1 there was going to be a
correction you know
um i'm no genius everybody saw it coming
and so generally after the first quarter
we do better right
and so let's get the first quarter
behind us and let's start on a recovery
and let's go
into another bull market we have the
opportunity to do that
and i hope congress don't jack that up
which they are good at doing jacking
stuff up
all right good people so let's look at
these stocks
leave me a comment good people let's
look at i know
there's a whole bunch of other clean
energy
charging stations and all of that it's
fine to leave a comment on that hey what
about this what about that
it's okay to leave those comments but
let's do a deep dive and let's look at
some
concrete companies let's look at some
steel companies good people
and this is going to help you broaden
your
uh portfolio remember we want the boat
to be
balanced we don't want to just be in
charging stations
and then let's listen to the the
president and let's see
what's in the infrastructure bill and
let's see where there's other
opportunities
to make more money i'm sorry you guys i
got allergies to make
more money okay so let's get busy
let's make a lot of money let's do our
research remember we're looking for
concrete and steel companies okay
and let's have another discussion after
the president
lays out his infrastructure bill okay
