boom all right what's going on you guys
it's royce jacob
welcome back to the channel in this
video i want to give you guys my top
three personal favorite trades right now
which is march 18th at the time of
recording so we are just gonna get
straight into this one guys let's
quickly go over the three names we're
going to be discussing today
i'll give you guys a short summary of
why i'm personally bullish on these
plays from a fundamental perspective
and then of course we'll dive into the
charts we'll hit training view talk
technicals
price action and price targets so first
up is gonna be the $ mission the $
rover you can see $ in the rocket
ship over here
that is $a$lyi or $alternate systems
if you guys have been following the
channel recently you would know that i'm
very bullish on this stock and i really
do think this thing is a sleeping giant
right now that's just waiting to pop off
so $a$lyi keep in mind right now you guys
always do your own dd on all these
companies
just because i think they're cool
doesn't mean that they are but i do
obviously personally see a lot of
potential in these and i do actually
have solo analysis videos
on all three of these companies if you
want to get a better idea of what they
do
um more in depth from a fundamental
perspective like what the company
actually does
of course because that's very very
important if you want to make an
investment okay
so again check those out if you want but
to summarize it quickly $$aoyi
is trying to be the $harley davidson of
evs they want to make
electric bikes electric motorcycles
actually have a very cool motorcycle
called the revolt
that they're actually dropping some
allegedly very very promising news on
tomorrow after i record this on march
19th friday
so i'm looking forward to that you guys
if you're if you're involved in the $$aoy
i definitely
keep an eye out for that article in that
news release but very cool looking bike
called the revolt
and they want to target sub-saharan
africa africa third world country
uh third world countries um developing
countries like
countries that are gonna be next up 10
20 50 years from now
with those bikes because two-wheeled
vehicles are actually much more
prominent
um than you would expect across the
world if you're fortunate to live in a
place like the united states
so that was very cool to learn and again
the mission is so amazing you guys
targeting again emerging markets that's
a better word for it not third world
countries but
emerging markets like africa like india
et cetera with these electric uh
electric bikes
obviously i mean which is where the
world's trending is all
is going to be all electric so very
bullish fundamentally there very cool
and it obviously has
a 10 million dollar mark cap which uh i
always say this you guys but it's true
this thing would have to 100x from here
to be a billion dollar mark cap and
if they can't properly execute on what
they're talking about
then i think it's they could easily
easily reach a billion dollar mark cap
like $nicola they just they
pretty much had as much as ly $$aoyi has
right now
they just had a concept no s$ales no
nothing but they got to like a 20
billion dollar evaluation so
a billion dollar evaluation is still in
the grand scheme of the of the financial
markets very very small
and uh again if $a$lyi does continue to
execute on what they're saying they will
then i think they could easily easily
attain that 100x
billion valuation okay which of course
would take us to about a 10
share price we're currently at only
eight cents so very very exciting
potential there
um next up is going to be the two
blockchain plays that i've been talking
about lately so
you guys know we talk a lot around here
about $ride blockchain $$marathon digital
holdings $ryan
the bitcoin miners um and i have been
saying lately that i do think capital
will start to flow
out of the bitcoin miners that have been
seeing so much love into the more
blockchain technology focus plays that
are excellent and $zeke and so
$xnet is inlay both of these are chinese
companies but they're both involved
again in the tech
the more tech side the cloud side the
app side of blockchain technology and uh
and and coins and whatnot $zikan actually
has a very cool
like like exchange ico coming there's a
lot of there's a lot of hype around
their ico
and that new exchange their new token
and whatnot so both of these very
exciting plays again you guys go dive
into them for yourself do your own
research
because right now we're primarily just
going to be talking technicals and i'll
talk to you guys about short term
where i think uh the three of these
plays could go okay so
price target again kicking it off with
$ale the $ rover i think it's very
likely that
uh very soon if this happens tomorrow
that would be very promising again a lot
of the crypto market was in the red
today so let's quickly scroll down you
can see
mar wright currency works right there
kanan a lot of red which is another
reason that
uh $exit and $zika are very appealing to
me right now they they outperform
significantly the entirety of the sector
today
and unfortunately bitcoin isn't looking
too hot right now we'll see where that
goes but i do remain bullish
on this sector as a whole but i remain
the most bullish on $xnet and $zikan
personally just because again i do feel
like capital will start to flow into
those sectors of the market but $a$lyi
because i do consider it somewhat it's
like
it's like a marriage of the ev and
crypto sector i do consider it a crypto
play
so it is very reassuring especially
because evs and kryptos were down today
like risk on assets
that $a$lyi was still seeing green so very
promising there like most of the market
was actually read today so it's very
very promising to see again this this
objectively speculative
risky play do well and be in the green
today and that makes me think that it
will withstand some of this volatility
and then appreciate in value when
everything else does as well okay that
only makes sense to me
uh so anyway let's focus let's focus on
these three kind of going off on a
tangent there apologize for that anyway
$$lyi short-term price target if this
happens tomorrow i'm not saying this is
going to happen tomorrow but
if this does play out if it tests the
line of resistance on the short term
uptrend that's currently on again
high low higher high higher low i think
we could easily make a higher high if we
hit it
by the end of the day tomorrow that
would take us to over an eleven cent $$lyi
which
again from considering we're at like
eight and a half cents now 11 cents as
far as a percentage gain is concerned
that's very very impressive
but of course we do have to focus on the
longer term as well after that let's get
rid of these guys now that was just for
the intro
um again the $ rover that is a white
shadow waves film that's an inside joke
um i think it's very likely that if we
do break above this signific this is a
very significant trend line right here
which i
i definitely need to explain so this has
acted for a while as a very significant
line of bull support and resistance over
the course of this crazy rally keep in
mind you guys
just uh $aoy has been an absolute roller
coaster on february 9th $ly i reached
20 cents we started talking about it way
back here at two cents it's crazy how
far it's come
and i believe again if you if you guys
been around you guys would know the good
old two wave theory the two wave theory
uh first wave first wave up this is just
how hype cycles work how parabolic fomo
markets work
uh first wave up you see that it get
definitely gets bubbly this is
this is very bubbly looking to me you
see the bubble pop you see capitulate
which just goes sideways you see it
start to gain some strength again
and that's where the second wave comes
in the second big wave so $aoyi short
term i do think this lineup this line
will come into play here primarily this
one
uh say if we can hit this one by the end
of the month on this kind of like
after the double bottom this bounce
right here uh bottom bottom double
bottomed out usually that's a bullish
sign
if we can hit this uh this target by the
end of the month i think it's more
likely this
comes into play the short term so just
say by march 24th or something like a
week from now
that could take us all the way up to 24
cents new all time our new all-time high
yeah for a $lyi uh past 20 cents
obviously just uh over a month ago
so that would be very exciting obviously
get more eyes on $lyi get more attention
more exposure
and again you guys with a company like
this exposure is very very important
because the market cap is so small
and it takes less capital inflow to
appreciate the individual share price
okay again just because the market cap
is so small
like if this gets if the news tomorrow
is really good and it makes like some
like even uh like midstream media or
something like if enough eyes are on
this
on this play then this thing can go
absolutely ballistic and that's again
you guys i don't know if it'll take one
year five years ten years or if it'll go
to zero
um i think this thing could easily hit
ten dollars at some point in time and
achieve that one billion dollar mark yet
but after this is broken after these
shorter term time frames are broken i
think it's very likely that we could
come up
to test uh the third wave or the second
wave i'm sorry so
i guess this is a little that's more of
a ripple so that's that's like a wake
right there this is the wave
second wave would come up to test the
overall line of resistance conservative
price target is going to be about 58
cents if we hit it by the end of the
month march 31st
and then uh not conservative but i think
this is very likely especially if we
break above like
the 60 cent region i think we could
definitely come up to like 65 66 cents
to test the overall line of resistance
on the greater uptrend now if we break
above that that's when we're actually
going
to $ $ is going to be way up here
$ is actually 10 but i keep it here
for the joke that i probably will make
every time
uh let's get that one right there but
again you guys i'm very excited to see
where this goes just because the mark
cap is so small the vision is so amazing
in my eyes
um i also want to make clear you guys
i'm i'm super stoked on this trade
that said i've very i've zero direct
affiliation with this company
i do hold shares i got a fat bag of $aoy
for full transparency
um but again i just want to share with
you guys because i think it's a crazy
asymmetric potential
uh asymmetric potential driven trade so
asymmetric potential obviously
asymmetric risk is when the downside
risk is significantly outweighed
by the upside potential and that's like
obviously you guys this thing could go
further down but i think that
uh the upside potential for my risk
tolerance as a trader
uh significantly outweighs the potential
downside of risk so i'm very excited to
see where this goes again you guys
dollar ten dollars 100 bucks who knows
where this thing could go over the
future
again granted they execute on their
plans and once again i'm keeping a very
very close eye
on that press release tomorrow because i
do i do know that it's
it revolves around the revolve bike
itself so
again you guys if you're interested in
this keep an eye out on that uh let's
see what progress they're making okay
so that said let's move on to the
blockchain beauties that arjun ley and
$zeke in so uh because because bitcoin
let's take a look at bitcoin quick
bitcoin is that like 57 000
it does not feel good to see you guys um
but i do still think uh bitcoin is going
to be in an uptrend like the
fundamentals around this sector are just
so hot this is still obviously in a
in a verified bull run and i still think
it's early so
uh that said i do think uh once again
because i think
capital will be going to flow out of
more hyped up more more
uh parts of the crypto sector that are
seeing love i think
capital will flow just into different
parts of the sector because people are
still gonna wanna
invest in crypto blockchain focused
plays but capital is just going to flow
around the sector i've seen this happen
over and over again and all the all the
hypes like all the hype sectors okay
so short term for $exit i think it's very
likely so if this plays out by tomorrow
because crypto isn't looking too hot
right now i wouldn't be surprised if it
doesn't
but i do think that at some point next
week $xnet will come up to test this
short-term line of resistance
again we are on the hourly rate now the
short-term line of resistance here
on this shorter the line of resistance
on the shorter term uptrend there we go
and that would bring us to say we hit it
let's just say mid next week around
march
march 23rd if we hit this trend line
right here the line of resistance again
on the shorter term uptrend
that would take us up to about 12 and 50
cents
so very exciting there but i think
longer term it's very light not even
longer term like short to medium term so
i think by the end of the month easily
$ly i could come up so april 1st right
there easy price target
i'll just do march 31st because that's
where actually these two intersect i
don't know if that's gonna play out but
it's just nice um
nice to see intersections of trend lines
on both shorts and media
short and long term time frames so these
would intersect on march
30th if that happens um again $aoy this
is the ripple or
sorry $xnet similar to $aoy the ripple you
get that first wave bubble pops
capitulation
second wave i think we could see again i
i think
i think 15 plus dollars is very very
likely this purple line is here because
that was
um right below 14 bucks was a pretty
significant line of resistance back in
2017
another very important thing to keep in
mind with $xnet is that like $riot $mara
are way like way way in their all-time
high territory okay like doubling their
all-time highs their previous all-time
highs back in 2017.
very different companies i know but
$xnet's high back in 2017 during the
crypto market of 2017
$xnet's high was 25 so if bitcoin is
pushing like 80 000
like i see especially if we get to that
like six figure bitcoin that i'm calling
for by over the course the next month or
so
i think that it's very likely we could
easily see $x net break to new all-time
highs especially because we're seeing
volume come back we're getting eyes on
this stock $xnet has a fairly small
market cap at just 600 million dollars
so
again does not take much capital inflow
to appreciate the share uh the share
price of these stocks $zeke
is very similar and i will say now i
said this in the newsletter this morning
so shout out to the newsletter
actually right now you guys i fully i
fully just got straight into it
please i will ask you before you
continue to please give the video a like
if you do go on to gain value from it
today
subscribe to the channel if you're new
around here and want to catch more
content like this follow these
revolutionary very exciting
again you guys i'm a pretty i'm a pretty
risk on trader i have a high risk
appetite and that's not for everybody
but
just to give you guys a heads up as to
my trading style i'm looking for
asymmetric potential again
where the upside potential significantly
outweighs the downside risk and i'm
looking for like multiples of my money
i'm not looking
for 10 20 50 like 50 even 50 i'm looking
to
like two five 10 100 x my money okay so
uh again uh subscribe to the channel if
you do want around here want to follow
more content
like this and of course check out my
complete portfolio daily newsletter
first link down in the description it's
15 bucks a month if you want a complete
breakdown of my entire portfolio um that
i do update every single trading day
during market hours
all call options put options stock
positions cryptocurrency positions
and uh with every update i do send out
an email newsletter explaining my
thoughts which is what reminded me again
because i did say in the newsletter this
morning that
$xnet and $zeken are reminding me of the
new $riot and $mar because again
$ryan $mara the the prince and princess
the two peas in a pod
do tend to play catch with these do tend
to play catch up with each other
do really stick together in terms of
price action and i'm seeing the same
exact thing play out with $zeke
and extant pretty much the exact same
price and that's why i really like these
as well too because
uh we're gonna be able to play catch up
in the future because they're probably
going to act very similarly
to $ryan $mars so keep that in mind top
side price target for $x that by the end
of this month is going to be about 16
so we'll just call that there very
exciting times you guys for this company
same for $zeke and so $x of course i do
have call options on $xnet
$zeke and you can't trade calls at least
on robin hood but
as far as the stock position is
concerned this is doing very well for me
and you're seeing a lot of volume here
which is really nice as well
so $zeken i think it's very very likely
that short term $zika is going to come up
to test this pretty pretty strong
trend line right here this is a little
more conservative so i'm safe doing i'm
i feel comfortable doing that
$zeke is in this nice shorter term
ascending channel right here so nice
nice kind of uh megaphone like ascending
channel not super perpendicular but i do
like those because the upside potential
is that much greater
so say say march 23rd let's extend this
a little bit just because again tomorrow
might be a little rough especially
because it is march 19th
it is a triple witching where many
futures expire
and that does cause increased volatility
to
in whichever direction the stock is
currently going so it's gonna be very
interesting to see what happens there
but i do remain bullish on the entire
crypto sector as a whole
and uh of course these blockchain focus
plays especially these blockchain
technology focus plays so
say mid 10 mid next week march 23rd we
test the top line of resistance on the
shorter
term uptrend now take us to about 12 and
70 cents
per $zikan which from here is a very very
exciting price action you guys
um again considering we're at 877 that
you're looking at like a 30
30 40 increase in price if we get close
to 13
so i think that's very likely that would
come ex$actly if we hit a 23rd
exactly to test the ulta the previous
high back in late february for $zeken and
$zeken is like the epitome of a two wave
so
you see the first wave maybe this is
just the ripple you guys
it's definitely not but this is like the
ripple right here boom first wave bubble
pops capitulation and we're seeing this
one really gain some steam so
longer term i would or like end of the
month talking so march 31st right here
i would not be surprised if $zeke can
actually looks really nice too
so look at that just like $exits so $zeke
can and $x have two peas in a pod like
i'm
very convinced of that that they will
act very similarly and uh also
actually $zeke and using this uh does
have a slightly higher price target so
maybe $zeke
is a $riot in exits tomorrow we'll see uh
regardless $zeke and price target by
april
1st is gonna be 18 conservative 17 you
guys just because you guys know i like
to keep it easy
actually this is conservative
considering a lot of traders are going
to be looking at at it like
like that so maybe this comes into play
if $x if
$z can breaks 18 bucks i think it's very
likely that this does come into play
and we could easily hit 20 plus dollars
uh if all goes very accordingly okay so
keep that in mind you guys again this is
just my opinion always know my money is
where my mouth is i'm
i'm heavily invested right now in all
three of these companies but as always
you guys make your own decisions do your
own due diligence figure out if these
are right for you
because they're definitely not right for
everybody that is a fact so
i appreciate you guys watching please
let me know in the comments down below
what your favorite
play that we just covered is why you
like to play and
what your price targets are personally
so i'll catch you in the comments
downstairs always love talking shop with
you guys
so until next time always remember take
action
make waves peace
