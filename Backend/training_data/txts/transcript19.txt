create a list of penny stocks that pay
dividends
we'll use a simple penny stock screener
then narrow our list
then i'll reveal seven penny stocks to
watch that pay you while you wait
we're talking penny stocks that pay
dividends today on let's talk money
hey bowtie nation joseph hogue here with
the let's talk money channel i want to
send a special shout out to all you out
there in the nation
thank you for spending a part of your
day to be here if you're not part of
that community yet just click that
little red subscribe button it's free
and you'll never miss an episode nation
you know we love those penny stocks here
on the channel from $veriton to $tell
euron and
$ryerson even $lagging elevate credit has
produced a 100
plus return in less than a year but we
also love us some dividends right
and when your holding period for a penny
stock is three to five years
that's a long time to wait without
getting paid and while most penny stocks
don't pay dividends you can get both
if you know where to look in this video
we'll start with a simple stock screener
to start our penny stocks dividend list
i'll then show you what to look for and
how to narrow your list
and how to pick the best for return and
cash flow then i'm going to reveal the
seven penny stocks to watch for the best
of both worlds
i want to get started here and jump into
those penny stocks but stick around
because
after those seven stocks i'm gonna
highlight three dividend penny stock
traps that you
need to avoid now i'll start my penny
stock list with the screener on weeble
and we'll be using the app for research
into each stock as well
i'll start by filtering for stocks with
a market cap under 500 million dollars
but you can play around with this
and really anything under a billion
dollar market cap and here i want to
address this because i know i'm going to
get
all kinds of comments there is no
official definition for a penny stock
the unofficial accepted basis is just a
company under a billion dollar market
gap
now those are the kind of small
companies with that flexibility and that
that potential for growth that we're
looking for now what a penny stock
definitely is not though is just a stock
under like
five dollars or one dollar per share you
see nation stock price really means
absolutely nothing for the value of a
company or its potential growth
it's a simple function of the market cap
of the company how much all
those shares are worth and the number of
shares issued for example $siriusxm
is a 26 billion dollar company
absolutely huge
and nobody would ever consider this a
penny stock
but since it has 4.1 billion shares
issued
each one trades for just six dollars and
32 cents each
now compare that with tiny little 98
million dollar $webco industries a steal
maker out of oklahoma with shares up
37 in the last year and really that
penny stock potential for growth
but because the company only has 887 000
shares issued
each one trades for a hundred and ten
dollars each so just don't think that
penny stocks have to be low price
low price stocks aren't cheap and high
price stocks aren't
necessarily expensive to find that
valuation
you need to be looking at things like
that price to earnings or the price to
sales
back to the screener though and next
we're going to make sure that our list
only includes dividend-paying stocks so
we'll move this slider to include stocks
that pay at least a one percent yield
now that's the basics but i like to use
this return on equity filter and the
return on assets filter to find
companies producing that positive return
on its assets and on their equity
it's just a quick way to narrow your
list down to the top performing penny
stocks
so we'll move these sliders on both of
these to at least a positive return
there are also some of these technical
filters here and sometimes i'll use this
rsi 24 oversold screener to find those
stocks with
good technical upside but since i'm
looking for these long-term holdings
here i'm not going to worry about it
now you can see how many stocks match
your screener at the bottom and i can
save my screen and it's going to keep
updating anytime i click on it so i'll
name this one penny stock dividends i'll
be putting all seven of these penny
stocks into my paper portfolio on weeble
to follow
i like the research here i get with
weeble but i love the stock simulator
feature
the app gives you a million dollars to
use in that paper portfolio to track
your favorite ideas before you invest
real money i'll leave a link to weeble
in the video description below
use that link and you'll get up to two
free shares of stock worth up to sixteen
hundred dollars when you open an account
and make your first deposit you'll get
two free shares a great app for
investing and you'll be supporting this
channel so i thank you for that now i'm
gonna show you the seven dividend paying
stocks next but what you're going to
notice
is that there's a lot of regional banks
asset managers and then business
development companies those bdcs on the
list
now these aren't going to be those 10x
kinds of penny stocks that you might
expect
but they can still produce a high return
and strong cash flow while you wait
in fact the seven stocks that i'll show
you averaged a 65
return over the past year and a dividend
yield more than twice the market average
now the question is though and i want to
get your opinion on this
would you rather have that higher
potential growth and maybe a penny stock
company that doesn't pay dividends
or still solid returns and that annual
dividend with it
so scroll down and let me know in the
comments below dividends plus growth
or maybe just that higher growth our
first penny stock here 377 million
dollar $masabi trust ticker $msb
a steel royalty trust paying a 4.8
dividend
and up 105 over the last year $masabi is
an amazingly simple investment
the company has a royalty investment in
mines operated by north shore mining a
subsidiary of cleveland cliffs
so north shore mines the ore processes
it into pellets and then sends it off to
cleveland cliffs
and then pays $missabe royalties based on
the selling price
so $musabi just has no operational duties
or
costs here it's just a trust that
receives those royalties
that means the return here is going to
be a function of iron ore prices which
are at
multi-year highs but still below the
peaks we saw in 2008 goldman sachs
believes we could be heading into a new
commodity super cycle and if we get even
part of that proposed three trillion
dollar infrastructure bill
my guess is prices are going to go much
higher and this stock will climb further
$capital southwest ticker $cswc is a 433
million dollar business development
company formed in 1961
and specializing in credit private
equity and venture capital to mid-market
and late-stage companies so the business
model for these bdc's is that there's a
funding hole for the mid-size businesses
now small business owners can go to
their local banks
and the big dogs can get bond funding or
just issue shares in the stock market
but for companies right around that
sweet spot of say 20 to 40 million
dollars in annual revenue
they go to these business development
companies for their lending and their
equity investments $capital southwest
pays a great dividend of 7.6
and has a history of regular
supplemental and special dividends
even last year it was able to keep up
that regular and supplemental dividend
stream
shares have climbed 140 over the last
year and the average debt yield on the
company's loans is 9.9 percent
which and this is something you always
want to check when you're investing in
bdc's you want to compare the weighted
average yield the company collects on
its loans
9.9 in this case against the dividend
yield because that's your measure of
dividend sustainability
is the amount that the company is
collecting on its loans above
what it pays out shares are trading at a
price of 1.3 times on that book value so
a little more expensive compared to some
of the other financial companies we'll
see on the list
but a solid dividend and a price return
now you're going to hear me use that
price to book value ratio with a lot of
these so i want to explain why
most of you are probably familiar with
hearing a price to earnings ratio used
to value a stock
the price per share investors are paying
compared to the earnings per share that
the company is generating for financial
companies though so these bdcs and the
banks
that book value of all their loans and
their other assets is
much more important so we look at the
price to book value for a more accurate
comparison
next on our penny stock dividends list
is a popular one $gladstone investment
corporation ticker $g-a-i-n now this is a
400 million dollar private equity fund
that also does some lending so that
business development corporation model
and the company focuses more on the
equity investment side though with a
target of
25 equity and 75 debt in the companies
that it works with $gladstone has a
diversified portfolio across
28 companies in 13 industries so good
diversification here that means
if there's trouble in one industry or a
company it's not going to totally break
the portfolio shares pay a 6.9
dividend yield with annualized
distribution growth around 2 percent
not including the supplemental
distributions it's been paying
now even last year the company was able
to pay that regular dividend plus a
21 cents per share extra dividend shares
are up over 71
in the last year and trade for a price
of 1.09 times book value we've still got
four more penny stocks to highlight but
i want to personally invite you to join
the daily bow tie
my free daily market newsletter with all
the stock market news
strategies and trends you need to follow
it's absolutely free just something i
like to offer for everyone out there in
the community so look for the sign
up link in the video description below
next on our penny stocks list 170
million dollar regional bank
$pins woods bank court ticker $pwod with
27 branches in pennsylvania under the
jssb
and lose aaron bank names $pins $pinswoods
has a net interest margin of 2.9
which is just under the pure average of
3.2 percent and
and remember that's the core
profitability measure for a bank
that net interest margin is the
difference that a bank collects and what
it charges on its loans
and what it pays out on savings so i
think there's room to increase this for
$pens woods
now the loan to deposits ratio is also a
little lower at 90 percent
loans to deposits under the peer average
of 93 percent
so what you have here is some potential
there to make more loans
at higher profitability and those of you
in the bowtie nation know stocks in the
financial sector are some of my
favorites for the year because
as those long-term interest rates rise
banks are going to make
more money on their new loans and shares
here pay a 5.4
dividend yield and are up 20 but still
trade for just 1.04 times on that price
to book value this next penny stock
gives us a little diversity from that
banking and the bdc theme
212 million dollar $waco group ticker
$w-e-y-s
waco is the company behind florsheim nun
bush stacey adams and the boggs brands
of footwear
selling through its own stores as well
as other retailers
florsheim is one of my favorite brands
for shoes and with the retail spending
boom coming this year
sales should do really well shares of
waco pay a 4.2 percent dividend yield
and are up 20
over the last year but traded just 1.1
times on a trailing sales basis which is
a good value for a retailer $lc and b
corporation ticker
$lc and b is a 224 million dollar
regional bank
with 33 branches across ohio formed in
1877. now if you've been following the
channel you know one of the things i'm
tracking in bank stocks this year is the
amount that the company set aside last
year in its loan loss provisions
now this is like a cash reserves account
that the company creates
just in case those loan defaults get bad
in a recession
the company takes that money out of its
operating profits and sets it aside
on the balance sheet well what we've
seen is that those loan defaults
haven't jumped like the banks thought
all that stimulus money saved small
businesses from the worst of the
pandemic
so banks have billions of dollars set
aside in this rainy day fund
when everything looks bright and sunny
$lcnb set aside more than
two million dollars in 2020 nearly 10
times what it had set aside the year
before
so if it now decides that it doesn't
need all that money set aside
even if it moves just one and a half
million back to earnings
that could be an extra 12 cents per
share for distribution shares pay a 4.24
dividend yield and are up 62 percent in
the last year
now $lcmb is also one of the least
expensive stocks here trading at just
point nine three times on that price to
book value topping out the list before i
share those three penny stock dividend
traps is a 129 million dollar
$union bank shares ticker $unb $unb runs 20
branches in vermont and new hampshire
and despite the pandemic reported record
earnings last year to a net income of
12.8 million dollars
loan loss reserves increased here as
well up 2.1 million dollars which
if released back into earnings would be
another 47 cents a share in profits
the shares pay a 4.6 dividend yield and
are up 40 percent in the past year
though this is one of the more expensive
stocks on the list at 1.59 times on that
price to book value now don't click out
i want to show you those three penny
stock dividend traps because
i see so many investors falling for
these and they will destroy your returns
first here is only looking for the
highest yielding dividends
nation we've tried to juggle that
dividend cash flow and the potential for
penny stock returns with these seven
stocks on the list but
there is a trade-off if a company is
paying out an eight percent plus
dividend then
there's a good chance it's not saving
much for earnings to fuel that stock
growth
with any company management has to make
that decision between returning cash to
shareholders
or investing for the future we've seen
with this list of penny stocks that you
can find that happy middle ground for
both next here in our penny stocks traps
is investing
only in those banks or the bdcs yes the
majority of these dividend-paying penny
stocks you're going to find are going to
be from the one of those two industries
either banks or business development
corporations
investing just in these though sets you
up for a fall if the interest rates fall
or if the economy tanks
so make sure that you're investing in
other types of companies like we did in
the list
this next one is a trap for all dividend
investors stocks that offer higher
yields
only because the price has fallen now
the penny stocks in our list have all
seen higher stock prices but do your own
search
and you're going to see some tempting
dividend yields of 10 and even higher
you absolutely have to check the graph
of the stock price here for example
shares of the geo group here look great
with a 12
dividend yield until you look at the
chart and see the stock has dropped
32 in the last year wiping out your
entire dividend return and then some
that high dividend yield is probably
unsustainable and could be cut
so make sure you're investing in strong
companies not just high dividends
