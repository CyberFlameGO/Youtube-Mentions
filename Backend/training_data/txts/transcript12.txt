what a time to be alive folks never in
my lifetime have i seen
so many industries that are in their
infancy on the verge of breakout at the
same time
we've got genomics lidar solar ev plays
carbon neutral mineral production not to
mention the two fun ones gambling and
cannabis there are a lot of
opportunities out there
in this video i'm going to be talking
specifically though about
genomics why this week could be a huge
week for the sector
and what stocks and penny stocks i'm
looking at in the industry so you'll
definitely want to stick around
but before i get into it if you get
anything out of this video leave it a
big fat thumbs up just like this
leave it in the comment section below
let me know which one of these you are
into and if you want access to our
wonderful private trading group
i think we got 20 200 we hit 2200
members today
sign up if you want access to that where
i send out all of my trades my
portfolios my options trades
we have a robust beginner section it's
simply the greatest trading group on the
planet in my opinion and if you want
early bird access to my options course
it is the first
link in the comments so why am i excited
for
the genomics space specifically this
week but in general for 2021
it is because of this potential catalyst
here
so kathy wood otherwise known as my baby
mama
will be talking on the ark webinar that
they have coming up that is
january 12th at 10 30 a.m pacific time 1
30 p.m
eastern time now this is intersecting
with the jp morgan healthcare conference
which currently is going on it's going
on for the rest of this week i think it
ends on thursday
now this is big because any major
announcements in the space
whether at the jp morgan health
conference or on kathy woods webinar or
both
there could be some major news catalysts
coming out of those conferences
now obviously we are not fortune tellers
so how do we leverage this well in my
view
what we have to do is we have to get
into stocks and funds that we are
excited about in genomics and if they
benefit from any sort of catalyst that's
discussed either on the webinar or at
the jpmorgan health conference
then that'll be an additional value add
now genomics like i said is one of my
biggest sectors for 2021 not just me but
a lot of analysts
because it is a an area of medicine and
science that is in its infancy
and it is now starting to scale where a
lot of these processes and tests
in genomic testing have become insanely
cheap compared to what they used to be
if you look at this graph in 2002 the
cost for genomic sequencing was a
hundred thousand dollars and it has
since
dropped to around 600 bucks today now
why this is important is fairly obvious
because
having a genetic map allows us to
capture diseases early
capture new strains of certain diseases
and then when you add that to something
like $crispr which we'll talk about in a
second
you'll be able to potentially do some
gene editing and eventually stub
out that portion of the genomic sequence
and if we take just
a small use case that is relevant to
current times
this headline says u.s urged to ramp up
genome sequencing to detect
new covet variants now if you
extrapolate that out to other viruses
and maybe
several forms of cancer or alzheimer's
or whatever you can see where the
trajectory is going
this is where medicine is headed just as
we could see that
cars are eventually going to be all
electric or mostly electric you could
see
in medicine even if you're not a doctor
or scientist
this is where it's heading because the
gene is essentially the source of
discovery all right now what stocks am i
going to be looking at first i want to
say
that i'm not trying to give the
impression that these stocks are going
to boom tomorrow or this week
but besides jp morgan and kathy wood we
don't know what's going to be discussed
exactly
at these conferences but you always have
to be prepared for
a potential catalyst that's why i said
at the beginning that we will look at
stocks that have good setups anyway
so even if we don't see a push in those
stocks just from this conference
you're still in a good setup but i also
do want to put this conference and arcs
webinar on your radar
so that you could pay attention and we
can maybe capitalize on future
situations down the road so i just want
to make it clear
i'm not saying that this event is going
to make everything boom but it is a good
start at highlighting genomics as a main
theme for 2021.
all right so how am i trading this first
let's talk about the obvious $arcg
in my view $rg is going to be the biggest
fun that arc has this year for 2021 like
i said genomics is
in its infancy and i think that $rg is a
buy at any retracement on my chart here
i have the 50-day moving average the
100-day moving average and the 200-day
moving average
orange yellow and green any time that
you see
$arcg falling to one of these moving
averages in my view you want to load up
that's
what i'm doing that's what we did we
bought $arcg the last time we bought
calls on $arcg the last time that that it
retraced
close to the to the moving averages here
on this retracement it was trading at
around
90 and capitalized on the short-term
move up
but you want to be adding on these dips
in my view
if you want to be exposed to an etf
powerhouse and specifically in the area
of genomics now the other
awesome thing i really don't like this
lighting man during the day there's like
a nice healthy amount of sunlight coming
in here so the lighting is more natural
but i look
really translucent with all this white
light anyway the good thing about $arcg
is there are also options so what i plan
to do
is the next time that i see $arcg falling
to one of the moving averages right and
and it will
obviously you could see the cyclical
nature here you just have to be patient
i'm not saying don't buy this stock if
you're a long-term holder you should be
dollar cost averaging anyway
but if you want to double down and play
options on this stock what i would do is
i'd wait for a retracement
because remember when stock price goes
down the price of calls go down
and i would go in here and i would buy a
leap so i picked the furthest expiration
date that is available
and i would pick something around like a
0.8 delta just
give or take you know a few percentage
points there and i would buy
the call and the reason that you're
buying leaps is because they cost a lot
less than buying a hundred shares of
stock so for instance
if i were to buy this 74 dollar leap
here
on $rg it will cost me 3 900
and i get to take advantage of most of
ark's move because the delta is 0.82
meaning i'm capturing
82 percent of $arc g's move by the way
the ticker symbol is $a
rkg if you haven't noticed but it's only
costing me thirty nine
hundred dollars versus if i bought a
hundred shares
of $arcg right now it'll cost me ten
thousand
four hundred dollars so i get to capture
most of $arcgi's move for
a much less capital commitment but
i'm only going to do this when i see a
retracement
because that is that is optimal it's not
to say that you can't do it now
you can it's just the most optimal time
to do it
is when $arcg is at a support level and
the price
has gone down thereby the price of calls
have gone down as well
now if you're into genomics you probably
know about $$crispr $$crispr is now 188
dollars
i'm kicking myself in the ass because i
$$crispr is actually one of the stocks
that i bought
around april and i wrote it to i think
about
70 or 80 dollars before i offloaded it
for profit and it's now 188
happens to the best of us no need to
beat yourself down profit is profit
now $$crispr is a gene editing tool and as
a matter of fact it is one of the
largest
holdings in $rg it is the largest holding
actually i take that back
in $rg you see here these are the top 10
holdings in $arcg
and $$crispr is almost 10 of their
holdings but there is an acquisition
candidate in the same realm that is
still in the baby stages and that is
$bluebird bio
this stock we actually did also by along
with $$crispr around the april time frame
and did end up selling it i think in the
60 i don't know 50 something 60
range and it is now back at the support
level but there it has been a lot of
rumblings about this as of late as an
undervalued genomics play and a
potential
acquisition candidate now this is not a
swing trade if you do get into $blue
this is a long-term hold but $blue's
price
at one point was 235
236 dollars it is now trading at 50
bucks
another potential catalyst is that this
company is waiting for approval
of its multiple myeloma treatment when i
talk about these things
i sound like a doctor i'm not i have no
idea what that is i just know that it's
a type of sickle cell disease i just
don't
know what makes this treatment so
special so i have to go by
what other analysts and other scientists
are talk are saying about it but
essentially it is a new way of treating
myeloma and $bluebird is waiting for fda
approval on this the decision is
expected sometime in the march time
frame now for 2021 this is sort of a
last ditch ever for $bluebird they have
four potential approvals on the table
for 2021
so it could either be a big year or a
dud but if you have room in your
portfolio for taking chances
this price i think is unbeatable at
around 50 dollars it is fairly low risk
because you can set a stop limit
at 40 or just below that and escape with
minimal harm but
i like this price for $bluebird and the
ticker symbol is $b-l-u-e for those of
you that want to take a look on your own
and lastly we'll talk about everybody's
favorite stock $bingo you guys were
getting on me
last video for saying $bingo but i know
it's not $bingo it's $bionano genomics
i call it $bingo for short ticker symbol
for all you haters is $bngo
just kidding but $bngo actually has a ton
of catalyst coming up
there was a pretty big news story that
somehow went under the radar today
but apparently the sapphire system which
is the cornerstone
of innovation may have uncovered some
insights into the pathogenesis of covid
19. so this is pretty big and if true a
testament that the sapphire system
actually works the way it was intended
and not only that it works on a
novel virus now another thing to keep in
mind is that $biome nano has a next
generation cytogenomic symposium
on january 15th yet another potential
catalyst inducing event as i always say
with binary events if there's
information that is known
it is likely priced in if there is
information that is announced that is
unknown
kind of like we saw with $neo then you
could see a price boost
so so a few short term things with $buy
nano and yes
if you guys are asking me yes i do think
it's a buy there are
a few things so january 12 is when their
share offering is concluded if you
didn't know
$buying nano recently did a share
offering which is why the price dropped
i did a whole video on it
and the price actually dropped from from
the highs
partly because of that share offering it
dropped almost 46
now i usually wait until the share
offering is concluded like i said which
is january 12th but i won't begrudge
anybody for entering
here and not trying to find the bottom
because regardless of whether you enter
at 567
or you enter at four dollars i do think
$buying nana will be significantly
higher in the short term few in the near
future so there's the share offering
which i already discussed and which $by
nano already fell
40 something percent after it was
announced but more importantly we're
already starting to see glimpses of
these of the power of their sapphire
system now i'm not going to act like i'm
deep in the industry and i know
whether there were some sincere doubts
about the sapphire system
or whether the consensus was that yes
this is actually a great way
of doing optical genomic mapping but i
do know among youtubers and youtube
commenters that the argument is live and
well that whether sapphire is viable or
not so
if this study holds true then this
already shows glimpses of
its power and to build upon that on
january 15th at their symposium if they
present these results along
with more context on top of that we
could see some announcements
and some results from studies that we
didn't know before and that could
further drive the stock price
up and obviously we have the never
ending rumors that arc is somehow
looking at $bayou nano
either way i think for this company for
$bngo it is gearing up to be
a big year in my view and i'll give you
one more
stock as a bonus that we already made
ten percent on today
and i sent this out on the trade alerts
$surrepta therapeutics
they dropped to their one and a half
year support level here
after it crashed we saw this with what
was the company actually
the company that ark holds this one
$arcturus therapeutics we saw a similar
crash
when it crashed 54 in one day to the
200-day moving average
and we ended up buying this as well i
love seeing these overreactions
especially if the company is like not
going out of business or anything
but it's a drop due to some bad news and
we saw
this violent 51 percent drop to its one
and a half year support and we bought
the bounce off of here and we made about
10 percent today but i'm going to
continue to hold this
until we see around 100 which is my next
target and we go from there but this
ticker symbol is $srpt for those of you
that are interested
anyway that is it for this video hope
you guys got something out of this video
if you did leave it a big fat thumbs up
just like this
leave it in the comment section below

in general
and some of the genomic stocks that i
talked about and if you have some
genomic stocks
