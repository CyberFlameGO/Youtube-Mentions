how's it going everyone it's sam today i
want to talk to you about
a couple stocks three stocks that have
massive catalysts coming up
now some videos people on youtube talk
about what's going to happen in the
future some talk about what's happening
in the past what just happened for some
stocks
these are three stocks that i think
could have really
good catalyst moving forward and they're
some of them are getting hit pretty hard
right now some are still actually going
up but i think
we'll go up faster because of what's
happening and i think this
video is going to provide you a ton of
value if you want to look at these
stocks like you have to do your research
of course but i think this is going to
offer a lot of value

so the first company we're looking at is
in the crypto space
now $coinbase is going public next week
and we don't know exactly what it's
going to be valued at yet
but a lot of people are saying around
100 billion dollars
now they had a banner quarter they had
about 1.8 billion dollars in revenue
this is a 900 increase from last year
at this time and i'm not looking at
$coinbase as much as another company
that's in the same space so there's
$coinbase
i i will be watching this one for sure
but there's another company that's
trading at almost the exact same price
to sales ratio
in the crypto space $$voyager digital
which is a company that's growing very
quickly
is doing pretty much the same thing as
$coinbase you can see that they have
about 650 million in net deposits from
march
they're growing very quickly they will
have about
60 million dollars of revenue this last
quarter
almost the exact same price to sales
ratio
as $coinbase if $coinbase comes public at
100 billion
valuation now if $coinbase jumps up which
i think it very well could because of
all the hype
if it jumps up to 150 150 billion
dollars
we could see we could see a massive
discount at $voyager compared to $coinbase
and $voyager still growing very quickly
so
that might be a great buying an
opportunity it might send $voyager up
actually as people look for other
alternatives
to $coinbase if it becomes too richly
valued and i hold $voyager i think it's a
really good play long term it's a three
billion dollar company
they're growing revenues from 1.7
million a couple months ago now
up to 30 million in a month with
$coinbase coming public next week this
one could have a lot of upwards momentum
and with any of these really we don't
need
bitcoin to do really well any kind of
volatility is where these companies make
money with the trading
so overall we want crypto to do really
well long term in these stocks
but if bitcoin goes down to 40 000 per
bitcoin and then back up and then back
down
that's probably good for these companies
now the next company we're looking at is
sense now i covered this in a video
recently
but this company this stock has been
getting no love recently
biotechs in general have been selling
off this one has a high short interest
this one is 50 off their highs
or 55 percent now and there's just not a
lot of
a lot of hype in the space anymore a lot
of excitement for biotechs
however their 180 day system should
probably be approved this summer so we
might see
some anticipatory run-up incense
because of people getting ready for this
of course we don't know that this will
necessarily get approved but we very
well think it will and we could see
some run-up before that and we could see
some run-up
after actually happens now we might see
a sell-off in that because
it is a it is a big milestone for them
and it's it might be one of those sell
the news type situations
i like the company long term i'll be
holding but if it if it runs up too
quickly
i say it's a long term hold but if if
any stock runs up too quickly i might be
willing to sell it
that being said if it falls down much
more i might be willing to buy more if
it falls in that two dollar range
i think this would present a pretty
interesting swing trade here
with their ever sense system hopefully
getting approved here soon
the next company is $clean spark this is
a grid in energy play
that recently got into bitcoin mining
and they gave us
uh an update where they expect
production of six to nine bitcoins per
day
by summer this one has just been beaten
down
it's been beaten down and being down and
beaten down we can see it was
a 30 stock a month ago it was a 40 stock
back in january
and it's 46 percent down now there was a
short seller report it caused it to sell
off
and then the tech sell-off recently
heard it
it's around a 732 million dollar market
cap
they get up to six bitcoin a day let's
say bitcoins at 50
000 for bitcoin which would be a 10
decrease from here they'll be 300 000
a day that's a hundred million a
a year right in bitcoin mining
that is a big number because this
company did
in the 10 million dollar range for
revenue last year
now they're growing pretty quickly they
have the whole other side their business
which is the energy and grid business
they're working on residential projects
too
but their bitcoin mining is a huge high
gross profit margin business it only
costs them
between six and eight thousand per
bitcoin to mine it
and they're making so much money on this
so we could see
massive profitability for for $clean
spark moving forward
if they're able to get up to the six to
nine bitcoin per day
that would be huge for them now again
they would be trading at a price to
sales ratio right around
six which is pretty low for one of these
companies that's growing so quickly
and they just completed a recent
uh capital raise so they recently got
200 million dollars
for their balance sheet this will be
really good for them moving forward just
helping them out with some liquidity
and again i think so many people are
discounting
how much revenue this company will have
this year now
they have their earnings in about a
month we should see
some good mining numbers and it might
bring more attention to this
it's been three months since the short
seller report there's some lawsuits
going on
they're securing more funding though
they're turning their
bitcoin mining carbon free which will
actually help
with the new infrastructure plan so
they're a grid company at heart
at the beginning they are electric grid
so
i think this might help them too if the
infrastructure plan actually goes
through
that money some of it could be going to
$clsk we don't know but that could be
another potential catalyst
now i think this one could run of course
you're taking some risk because of the
lawsuit but
again i think it's definitely worth
thinking about
if you haven't already put money in $clsk
now i haven't put
more money in them in the last couple
weeks but
i'm strongly considering at this point
and i already have a
decent sized position in them now
yesterday or today depending on when
you're looking at this
i did a video talking about this new
tesla underground system in vegas and
i'm not sure i did a good enough job
explaining
how big this could be for their
autonomous and me
kevin did a really good job explaining
this i think right now they have a one
mile stretch or a couple one mile
stretches
underneath uh las vegas where they are
going to have these teslas
run autonomously this could be as me
kevin said the trojan horse for them to
get into autonomous
much faster than we might have thought
because this is solving a problem for
vegas right people don't want to walk
outside in the summer
so this is solving a problem for them
and it kind of it might
bring them into other cities let's say
in texas they're saying okay well yeah
we'll take
one of these systems too and then
autonomous work so well they're like
okay we'll do it just above ground
because it'll be faster
it'll be easier for people we'll just
have the the
system go right on the main streets and
then from there they're saying okay well
you can just give us autonomous teslas
in general
and that's where their autonomous taxi
network comes in so i think this is
gonna be huge for them once they get
this up and running with the autonomous
side
and i'm really excited about this too i
own a decent size
position in tesla thank you guys so much
