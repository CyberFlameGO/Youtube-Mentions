profits at the bell

i hope you guys enjoy the recap and i'll
see you first thing tomorrow morning
during the morning show
all right everyone so we're going to do
our midday market recap here
um i'm finishing the morning up twenty
thousand
i was uh beat by farad he
uh posted a screenshot of being up
forty thousand today double doubled uh
doubled the teacher so baby bird has
left the nest good for you man we're
super impressed he's got
a 100k badge in the chat room and uh
that's always
good to see i'm i'm genuinely happy
i have i i mean i'm competitive but i'm
i'm genuinely happy to see you doing
that well it's great
so my trades uh from today
uh up twenty thousand as always uh
in case you didn't already know trading
is risky most beginner traders lose
money my results are not typical
um neither are uh our his or probably
uh anyone that made forty or fifty
thousand dollars today
uh we would be among the uh minority
however this is the strategy i trade
every day it's momentum trading
and it's a buy high sell hire type of
strategy and $apop
was one of the ones that i did quite
well on although it was
uh risky for a couple of reasons
um pre-market had made this really big
move
um this was actually after hours it
drops down then pre-market it surges up
to a high of 880.
now when i saw $apop on the scanner i was
like
all right $apop i know this stock
all right i know this stock because it
has a history of popping up
and selling off but the fact that it has
a history of making big moves is
sort of what's more significant because
in each of these days while these days
closed
red there was still a lot of volatility
and a lot of opportunity
and so i traded it on many of these days
we go back a little bit further there's
you know you just look at the volume you
can see these are the big days
so i knew $apop had a high likelihood of
being another kind of
pop and drop fade type of stock
since it's done that in the past and
initially when it was in this area 466
i had no interest i was like nope not
interested at all
and at that time i was actually trading
$cyth which i'll talk about those trades
in a second this one also a pretty
disappointing day here it's actually
it's actually lower than yesterday um
despite what seems like good news
anyways $apo people focus on this one
first so
on this one i just i started getting
interested in it
as it approached the volume weight
average price right here as it spiked on
this candle i was like all right you
know what it's up over a dollar a share
clearly it's moving
it makes sense i think at this point for
me to try to find some opportunity on it
and so i actually if you look at this
right here
this was a one minute pullback
underneath the volume weight average
price
and i got long right here boom
jumped in that trade up to 590. pulls
back around six
another one minute pullback right here a
trade through
six doesn't hold that level drops back
down pulls back
drops down and then at the open a nice
gap and go
but a little wild pretty wild a lot of
volatility right at the open here and
then it
came back down so you know in this area
and this you could almost look at this
as a um head and shoulders pattern the
shoulder here the head here and the
other shoulder on this side
i don't know that it's perfect but um
but you can kind of visualize that i'll
i'll grab a screenshot of this to add to
the classes
um for the next the next time we do
live classes let me just grab this here
so
uh $apop let me
let me pull up one of my recordings here
so warrior pro students
you'll have access to
this in the live archives you can watch
it and re-watch it
uh but coming right into the open
uh it was it was wild and and i knew it
was gonna be wild i knew that it carried
a lot of risk trading these at the open
um we just can see some wild moves so
we're about 30 seconds from the bell
here in this recording
so you're gonna see the open in just one
second and
so the lowest risk trades in my opinion
were on
the earlier one-minute pullbacks
before it kind of started to get
choppy and of course right at the open
is obviously when we see
um you know high levels of risk so
as we come into the bell we know that we
have a high likelihood of seeing a big
whip
so here's the open the bell rings i
start
i saw some i thought i saw some green on
the tape let's see it was right back
here
um i think i saw some green like right
there at 68 69
878 and i said all right i'm punching it
in 12 000 shares at 79.
looking for the breakthrough six there's
95 96 97 98.99 it's got a breakthrough
six
six and i'm saying no i'm worried
because this could reverse instantly and
that's the type of thing we've been
seeing
on these at the open so sold it there at
93 which
on twelve thousand shares is like
fifteen hundred dollars
and then looking to add back orders at
610
adding back right there for the
breakthrough 6. there's 6 10 615.
nice order goes out to sell half at 612.
taking some profit off the table there's
618
620 taking a little more off the table
now i'm going to let it dip
new order moving it up to 620 and there
and i continue trading that's a little
sneak preview of what warrior pro
students get to see
in the live trading archives so i'm not
going to do the whole thing
on youtube but educational i'm sure i
hope you guys enjoy it and
definitely a wild
wild ride this morning on
$apop uh all the way up to 7 15. i think
my best exit on this
was probably around uh actually i got a
hmm well i got i got a partial fill exit
at 7
10 but i also added at 7 10. so that was
kind of
i bought and then i guess i sold but
anyways so that was $apop
uh it's selling off now i'm not
interested in it anymore
uh $cyth uh was also one of our leading
gappers
our leading gapper today was $apop second
leader $hwcc
buyout immp this is one of the ones that
farad was trading
and he obviously did really well on that
one
i didn't trade it a little bit of a
bigger float wasn't sure whether or not
it was
going to be a big momentum stock but
anyways it's
you know it's just uh just kind of the
way that is and then $c-i-d-m
and $e-n-o-b um
let's see $e-n-o-b and then we had
$c-y-t-h
good call mark i will check that
um
yeah that i might have to look at i'm
gonna have to look at that especially
with bigger size it's a good call
so i'm just gonna make a note on that um
let's see
okay so $cyth
man what a disappointing uh what a
disappointing sell-off there from 1350
down to nine
i mean that's that's really kind of it's
a bummer to see that when the stock
actually had news
um you know but sometimes this happens
and so pre-market we were watching it
and i said all right well this is the
first five minute candle to make a new
high
i don't want to buy that because it's
below v web it's a little too weak
didn't buy that but then did buy um
right around this area here on a dip off
of the v-wap
bought this dip off v wap and caught
this squeeze here up to three uh 13.70
took some profit out added back on a dip
took some more profit up in the 13
50 60s but unfortunately it didn't hold
that level it rejected
i was hoping i tried to do a bounce off
the v-wap and it broke
below it and went lower it just couldn't
hold up
and it's really a shame because it
looked it looked like it had a lot of
potential and it looked like it was
going to be
the leading gapper and then you know as
we had this sell-off coming into the
open
all of a sudden it started dropping down
the gap scanner and it was actually
gapping up only 10 percent
which is not the big gap that i was
hoping for so
uh so that that was at that point when i
switched from $cyth to focus on $apop
which between the two at that moment was
certainly looking better
uh and you know it's probably worth
noting just because of the way the
market works that
when there's one obvious stock a lot of
sort of the other stocks will fade as
all the focus is on one stock
and that was $apop so if $apop
had not popped up it's actually possible
that $cyth
would have gotten more attention because
it would have still been something
people would have been looking for dip
trades on you know people usually just
look at the most
kind of volatile biggest gapper and then
just start actively trading it
and so sometimes you have the case where
you have one that's the obvious one and
then it kind of goes
out of favor as another one picks up
that makes an even bigger move and
everyone sort of sort of
switches focus to that one i mean you've
got
millions of traders out there and so
it's
not surprising with access to high a day
momentum scanners and things like that
that most traders are going to focus on
what's moving up right now
because momentum trading is buy high
sell higher and that certainly was the
case on
all of these stocks today it's it's
always the case whether we're talking
about $gamestop
$apop or $cyth i mean it's
stocks moving up by high sell higher
this could have been a one minute micro
pullback right there at 134
on $gamestop went up to 144. i didn't
take that trade and feel comfortable
with the risk on it but it's just it's
the same
the same idea so anyways um
that's where i finished today and
this is where i'm sitting on the month
gross profit 340
net profit 293 accuracy a little lower
than i'd like
profit loss ratio you know one-to-one
not as good as i'd like but
you know that's where i sit right now so
look at the overview we'll get the
calendar
and i'll go back to gross so this
is this is my month right now and not
including of course today which i'll
i'll add tomorrow but we have four days
left
friday monday tuesday wednesday and
my daily goal is 20 000 a day right now
i hit i hit it today and
i'm i'm i'm there today i've actually
been
averaging 21 000 it looks like a day so
far this month
so far this year i've been averaging
30 000 a day and gross but only 26 in
net
i've spent a lot of money already this
year in commissions
but i did last year as well and
it's just part of the deal i mean i
could try to trade at a
commission free broker but i don't think
certainly at the open
the way i was trading how quickly i was
trading something like $apop
i just don't think i'd be able to do
that with
td ameritrade and i say that having
tried it and
having not been very successful at it
and of course i shared that experience
with you guys so
my two cents is you know find the right
tool that's a good fit for you if it's a
more expensive tool but it
gets the job done then it's the right
tool lightspeed is more expensive but i
think it's the right tool
and so i'm i'm willing to pay pay that
commission
in order to get that high speed routing
and everything else so
it's just about what's what's suitable
for you and i know a lot of you guys do
use
other brokers free commission brokers
and stuff like that and for your
strategy or your
sort of twist on the momentum strategy
that i trade
maybe fine but anyways you do what works
for you so
as always uh again i'll just put up my
disclaimer here's a reminder
as we finish this recap the trading is
risky most beginner traders lose money
with that in mind trade in a simulator
before you put real money on the line
