hey what's going on everyone it's
griffin here and i hope you're all
having a great day as always now in my
last video i spoke about how i took a
short one-week break off from making
stock market-related videos specifically
stock updates and
i took this time off as an opportunity
to audit my whole portfolio
and really see for each one of my
positions whether or not i wanted to buy
more
hold or even trim off some of these
positions based on more up-to-date
research
and business developments i also
mentioned that considering current
market environment this was a great
opportunity to invest more into your
highest conviction stocks rather than
maybe taking on
some more speculative plays cluttering
up your portfolio so that's exactly
what today's video is about speaking
about some of my highest conviction
stocks as of right now
in fact this is an exercise that is
critical for all long-term investors
because it allows you to revisit each
one of your holdings and rebalance each
position
based on the desired weight considering
your asset allocation mix
which is always important to maintain so
yeah today's video is going to be
covering up four stocks that i've been
doing some further research into either
because i hold them in my portfolio or i
am potentially looking to open up a
position and honestly i've been doing
research on
dozens of stocks over the past couple of
weeks and considering current market
environments there aren't that many
stocks that i personally see
as being opportune at their current
price points and valuations
based on all the other information that
i was doing research on so
do keep in mind that these are stocks
that i would at the very least
put on your watch list for the month of
april and i'll also be doing a part 2 to
this video around
mid april so make sure to subscribe to
the channel so that you're up to date
on these upcoming videos as a side note
historically speaking
april is typically a good month to buy
stocks
for further growth throughout the rest
of the year so if you're looking to open
up a new position or add to some
existing positions
that you have a very high conviction in
then make sure to
take this month as an opportunity so
with that said let's get right into
the first one for today's video all
right so the first stock that i've been
really eyeing lately and wanting to
bolster my position in
at current price points is amazon ticker
symbol amzn
on the nasdaq and this is a company that
pretty much everyone
is familiar with at least as a customer
and if you're a stock investor
then most likely you either hold amazon
already in your portfolio or have
considered buying into this company at
one point or another and by the way if
you hold let's say a nasdaq 100 or even
an
s p 500 etf you do have some exposure to
amazon this is one of the largest
companies in the world at a market
capitalization
exceeding 1.5 trillion us dollars and as
of filming this video the stock is
trading for
right around three thousand one hundred
and thirty dollars per share
which is up this morning following the
broader tech market movement
but happens to still be down roughly 10
from the 52-week high of 3 52
per share which was achieved in
september of 2020. so
quite interestingly though the world's
largest e-commerce player
has been trending relatively sideways
for the past eight months even
considering the pandemic's push
towards further ecommerce adoption along
with all of the other
innovative branches of amazon's business
model i've spoken quite a bit recently
about my bullish views towards a handful
of key industries that i see
growing exponentially over the next five
to ten years
and e-commerce is one of my main focuses
alongside
the cannabis market in the united states
as well as renewable energy worldwide
so at current price points though
amazon's trailing price to earnings
ratio
is around 74.8 which definitely makes
this an expensive stock but
based on forward guidance their pe is
just under 50
and regardless this is a company that is
set to continue growing at an
unbelievable pace over the coming decade
what we need to remind ourselves here as
investors is that while amazon is most
well known for
their retail or e-commerce distribution
platform that is
well they are also expanding into
multiple different firms as well as
industries that are set to grow by leaps
and bounds over the coming years making
this somewhat even of an internally
diversified position
just to name a few some of their main
subsidiaries include
twitch which is one of the main
streaming platforms for gaming
audible which we all know for ebooks as
well as amazon web
services whole foods twilio and zappos
and in this book that i've recently been
reading called the future is faster than
you think
amazon is brought up constantly for the
disruption that they're bringing
to multiple different industries that
are gonna have profound
impacts on our lives over the coming
five to ten years
i mean honestly i didn't even realize
how diverse amazon was
and how disruptive they're looking to be
for all of these key industries so
if there's one thing that i kind of got
out of the book even though it's not
about this it's that
you should be buying amazon stock and
holding for a five to ten year hold
minimum
so yeah we can see here that amazon's
top line growth is
truly unbelievable over 100 billion
dollars in 2020 sales
above 2019 sales with very little
that can stop this company's momentum
their net income has also been
increasing quite steadily over the past
couple of years
and is expected to continue growing at a
very nice pace
through to 2025. i mean just look at
this
expected future growth chart here by
2025
amazon is expected to make 730
billion dollars in that year and have
earnings of 65 billion
the company's balance sheet is also
fantastic with rapidly growing assets
relative to debts while their cash and
equivalents
are on an ever increasing uptrend
realistically if you're looking for a
rock solid mid to long term hold you
really can't go wrong with amazon the
amount of disruption that they're
bringing to
multiple different industries and their
current and forward dominance
on the retail or e-commerce retail i
should say
is just unparalleled so yeah i would
definitely think that
amazon is a stock that either you should
be opening up a position in
and or looking to do so in the mid to
near future
finally 31 analysts have an average
price target of four thousand
one hundred and six dollars per share
which would mean an upside of thirty two
percent on this stock
over the coming years with a bull case
of five thousand
two hundred and even the lowest price
target we're looking at for amazon
is 3700 which would still represent
roughly a 20
upside which is really nice all right
moving on to the second stock that i
honestly just could not leave out of
this video even though i have spoken
about this company
quite a bit over the past couple of
months on the channel and so for this
reason
some of you might be a little bit sick
of hearing it but
i'm just so bullish on this company and
the industry that it operates in
and considering the fact that they
recently just released their q4 earnings
figures which were fantastic
i had to highlight these in today's
video the company is truly
cannabis ticker symbol t-r-u-l in canada
and tcnnf over-the-counter in the united
states
now since i've spoken about this company
a lot lately i might sound like a broken
record at this point so i'll keep it
pretty brief and quickly go over their
q4 earnings
so true leave is obviously a cannabis
company and its current dominance is in
the florida market where it owns the
largest majority of the market share in
that state
and since we've recently spoken about
true leave let me just fill you in on
the q4 figures since this is new
information to the channel
as expected revenues are up
substantially for continued growth in
cannabis sales and total sales were
521.533 million
in 2020 representing growth of 268.7
percent
over 2019 figures this was totally to be
expected considering their dominance
over the florida cannabis market and
expansion into
new states honestly true leave continues
to impress me with their growth and is
expected to continue on this growth
trend
we can see from this chart that by 2025
the company's top line
is expected to hit roughly 1.3 billion
and their bottom line should hit over
330 million
making this by far the most profitable
cannabis company
at the moment moving on their income
from operations was 218 million
up 105 percent over 2019
and their basic earnings per share were
55 cents
up 7 cents over 2019. regarding their
balance sheet
total assets are now 816 million
up 385 million since last year
with a current ratio now sitting at 3.53
so yeah trell maintains strong liquidity
and a solid balance sheet as a backbone
for their growth and one last thing
about the cannabis market we're seeing
more and more states legalizing adult
recreational use cannabis just this past
wednesday governor andrew cuomo of new
york has signed a bill to legalize
recreational use marijuana and being the
fourth largest state by population
this provides massive opportunity for a
company like true leave
i mean honestly we're just seeing
fantastic business and financial growth
for true leave and there's really
not that many negative elements that i
can bring up or even highlight
for this company's growth over the
coming five years that i can see from my
research
as of right now i am a shareholder of
truly though and i hold around 115
shares of the company
which fluctuates between five and six
percent of the portfolio's weight but
honestly i'm so bullish on this company
that i would even bring that position up
to
maybe even ten percent of the portfolio
i really just see tremendous upside
for the continued growth of this company
and as a result their stock as well
even analysts are projecting very nice
price targets for true leave over the
coming year
as demonstrated from this chart and by
the way since i'm very bullish on the
continued growth of the cannabis
industry as a whole i've pretty much
analyzed every single one of these
companies
and from my research other than aphria
which i'm still a shareholder of since
around three dollars per share as of
last year and i've only sold off a
certain portion of that position
well true leave is really the only
cannabis company that i'm currently
investing in
and a dollar cost averaging on the dips
moving on to the next stock this is a
company that
is new to the channel but that upon
further research i
am considering opening up a first
position in at current price point so
no i am not yet a shareholder of this
company
when and if i do end up opening up a
position though i will be letting
my patreon community know first so
definitely make sure to check out the
link
down below to access our discord group
as well as
all the patreon exclusive posts that i
post on there but the company i'm
speaking about is
baidu ticker symbol bidu on the nasdaq
if this is the first time that you hear
about this company well it is an
internet search provider in china
essentially think of it as the google of
china
but considering the fact that google is
banned in that country
well this is their largest player in the
search space and while baidu does
primarily offer a search platform there
are many other online
websites and services that are banned in
china that we're used to using in north
america
so baidu is the main provider of
alternatives for their country
including a wiki website social media
platform
healthcare wikis and more so with that
said why would i be bringing up
this company though instead of speaking
about google then well truth be told
google is pretty much always a great
company to buy and hold in your
portfolio
it's just an absolute monster of a
company but baidu has seen some
very bearish movements over the past two
months with shares
plummeting over 33 percent from its
52-week high
of 354 dollars per share and as we can
see from this chart
it would appear that the market is
showing some resistance for this stock
at around the 200 per share level going
back to
january of this year so yes it did
bounce off of this resistance line
last week and now i expect that we'll
see a reversal for this company's stock
over the coming months and why this is
also a great time to buy baidu
right now well one of the main reasons
why the stock continued to crash
down past the 230 dollar level was
because
baidu was part of eight stocks that were
massively liquidated by the hedge fund
archigos capital that got a margin call
a couple of weeks back so this had a
direct impact on baidu share price
as this hedge fund liquidated a massive
amount of stock
so essentially what i'm saying here is
that this share price having plummeted
further over the past couple of weeks
was
very much tied to this incident and now
makes baidu stock
really attractive from a valuation
standpoint as we can see from this chart
the company also has expected revenue
growth of
13 annually through to 2023
which should help the stock recover over
the coming years and provide some very
nice upside for
investors speaking of stock upside 18
analysts have an
average price target of 349 dollars per
share
over the year showing upside of 70
and based on the stocks current price in
parallel to their earnings and other
financials
i think this is very achievable finally
baidu also has a great balance sheet
with over 162 billion
chinese yen which is enough to cover the
entirety of the company's debt
so again i haven't yet opened up a
position in baidu
i'm somewhat hoping that it'll drop back
down to around the 210
per share range at which point if it
does i will absolutely be opening up a
position
and on the flip side if we do end up
seeing continued bullish price movements
for attack in general
as well as baidu i wouldn't mind opening
up a position
under the 230 per share range for the
coming year minimum
and finally the fourth and last stock
for today's video that i think at the
very least you should be adding to your
watch list for the month of
april is teledog ticker symbol t-doc on
the nyse
and again this is a company that isn't
necessarily new to the channel but that
upon
further analysis and especially
considering the current price point that
this stock is trading at
i really wanted to bring it up once
again for the month of april as my
convictions towards telehealth
have not changed one bit and tdog being
one of the main players in the american
space
with a share price that is down roughly
40
i believe this stock should be on your
radar as this is an opportune time to
potentially buy in for the first time
for a multi-year hold now in terms of
share price movements there seems to be
a support line
around the 170 dollar mark going back to
last november but look it isn't out of
the question that values could continue
to drop back down
to the 140 150 range i'll be honest here
i did make the mistake of getting
back into tdoc at an opportune time it
was somewhat premature
after i got out of tdoc at around the
280 dollar per share range
that was triggered by a stop limit order
that i set for this stock
i got back in at an average share price
of around 213 dollars which
obviously in retrospect now was
significantly uh too
early however considering how the price
has been
trending over the past couple of weeks
now well below 200
per share i have no problem whatsoever
buying more and dollar cost averaging to
lower my cost basis for a multi-year
hold
with that said if you're looking to
either day trade or shorter term swing
trade on
a position like tdoc or pretty much any
other position for that matter that i
speak about on my channel then
this is definitely not going to be right
for you as we're looking here for
investments that are going to grow over
the coming
five-ish years minimum i've been seeing
a lot of posts lately on forums and
other videos that telehealth is dead and
honestly i just think that
is foolish if you look at a more macro
point of view here so
telehealth is an industry that is 100
going to thrive over the coming five to
10 years
medicine is one of the industries that's
going to be disrupted the most in this
time frame
and a company like tdoc is definitely
one of the best players to be invested
in
if you want to ride at this wave now
could we see more volatility in the
industry and this company in particular
absolutely and so this is the company
that i would not recommend
owning if you're not willing to hold on
through volatility but for me and based
on
my convictions i think tdoc is just a
great company to hold
if you don't have any telehealth stocks
at all and you're looking to first open
up a position
tdog should be it as it's one of the
largest players in the united states
which has the largest healthcare market
in the world and is poised for the most
disruption and growth tdoc's financials
have also been growing like a
weed despite lots of investors being
worried about the stock being a
coveted play that's just not what we're
seeing based on top lane growth and
projected growth
through to 2025 it is expected to reach
5.5
billion at annual growth of 25
all this to say that at current price
points if you haven't yet opened up a
position
in telehealth or tdoc i think this is an
opportune price point
however do not be surprised if we
continue seeing
higher volatility than the wider market
for a company like tdoc
and once again if we see the stock
continue to tumble down
around the 150 range i will be loading
up
on this company and that wraps it up for
part one of stocks to watch in april
