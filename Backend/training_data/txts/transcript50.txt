continuous downtrend

let's jump right into this video all
right so here is the robinhood portfolio
i'm gonna actually have a video coming
out here soon going over the whole
portfolio i know it's been a while since
i've done an update
but i did like i said purchase some more
stock
in $zom and i am also looking to do
some options plays here pretty soon on
one of my stocks i actually announced it
to the discord this morning
so if you guys are interested in that
make sure you stay tuned hit that
subscribe button if you guys want to see
that video come out about
uh the next options trade i am looking
at doing so as
for $zom like i said i did just recently
purchased some more shares
of $xeom again guys this does not make up
a very large position
of my portfolio whatsoever i feel like i
need to be up forward with that
because whenever i'm talking about a
stock i want it to be known that like i
don't have a very large position with
$zom
at all and that's for a couple reasons
and we're going to get into that in
today's video
but also i do want to stress this guys
this stock
is one that's you know it's it's not for
someone who thinks stocks always go up
because
let's be honest that doesn't happen this
is a stock that first of all
is a speculative investment and
basically what a spec play is it's
whenever you are
hoping that something happens you're not
buying this company based on
fundamentals
because $z-o-m still isn't even a
profitable company
so you are buying the stock in hopes of
things to happen in the future
and just for a quick learning session
here things sometimes don't always work
out as what you hope
so it's best to be investing large sums
of money into stocks that have good
fundamentals
that you've done research on that you
know is a good solid company and a good
solid business
and keeping your more spec plays your
more gamble plays
with companies like $zom and making sure
that that is a
very very small percentage of your
overall portfolio because you don't want
to get worked up too much you don't want
to get motions in the play here
to where you're thinking $xeom's going to
hype up and then all of a sudden
boom it tanks down like it's been doing
for the past week or so
i mean look at this it was up to two
dollars and fifty cents now it's back
down to one dollar
and forty cents it was down under a
dollar thirty just uh yesterday i
believe so
anyways guys that's that's the one thing
i do want to mention here quickly on
today's video
but as for the news we did mention this
in a previous video but i wanted to say
here again that there was the first
initial sale of true forma before that
march 30th deadline
and the purchaser was jason berg he's
the founder and president of the
guardian
veterinarian specialist it's a 29 000
square foot advanced
emergency critical care unit now i will
say this
the there hasn't been any at least to my
knowledge and what i've seen
and i've been trying to keep up with the
$zom on a daily basis i have not seen any
other sales come out
of this company or at least any news of
big purchases
so that is one thing that worries me
about $xeom
but with that as for the big news i
wanted to talk about today
$zom did have an announcement or there
was some news that came out
that $zom has been added to the smp
pharmaceuticals etf and i can click here
and show you
the all of their holdings in this etf
let me zoom in here real quick
so as you can see right here in the
middle of the screen $zom $zometica
does make up portion of this etf and
their actual weighted amount is 2.46
percent
so 2.46 percent of this total etf
is made up of $zometica shares so there
are some big players in here too guys
you got stocks like
uh companies like $pfizer uh $merck
$johnson johnson
$bristol meyer squibb company so there's
some big names in this etf
and that is huge for a company like $zom
because what that does is that is more
money that's going to flow in
to buy up more shares of $zeon because it
is placed in an etf now
so that's something else to keep in mind
as well now as for my final thoughts on
$xeom i wanted to keep this one quick
guys i try to keep this one short
is i did purchase a very small amount to
average down my cost basis
on $xeom now i have been previously i
have bought and sold
to take profits in $xeom as it's been
climbing up
before it hit that 2.50 mark uh and then
i have been buying a little bit more as
it's been going down and i did sell for
some profits
at the two dollar mark as well so as you
can see usually i'm typically a long
term
uh buy and hold investor but with $z om
it's a short term position for me
and it's a stock that i plan on just
kind of buying and holding and this
stock could be a stock that i plan on
holding for the long term but right now
i'm buying on dips and i'm selling on
the highs and i'm just kind of playing
this with some short term
very very small amounts of money i
cannot stress this enough guys is how
important
it is to be able to set yourself up and
to not get
too far ahead of yourself with some of
these more speculative plays because
that is exactly
what $z-o-m is with not being
a profitable company with the news of
all this relying on this one product
true form of performing well
there are a lot of catalysts that could
bring this stock back down to the 30 40
50 cent level
so i just fair warning here be careful
when you're buying stocks like this guys
because these are very very risky plays
and you need to be willing to put in a
hundred percent
of the money that you would be willing
to lose if something bad would happen
with $zeon because again it is such
a speculative play here so guys i hope
you enjoyed the video uh those are my
thoughts on $zeom again like i said i did
buy
a very small amount to average down a
little bit and my
total cost basis with $zom and we are
going to wait and see what happens over
the next couple months or so
and see if they do get more sales of
true forma where the stock price is
going to go
and what i end up doing with this uh
with my position in this company
