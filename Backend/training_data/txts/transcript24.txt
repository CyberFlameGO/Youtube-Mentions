so in today's video we'll be going over
three stocks to buy
in december 2020. i always make
these update videos every single month
but this month was a lot more difficult
to make
than all the other months so if you guys
been investing since if you guys have
been investing with me and following me
since march
of 2020 then basically you could have
bought almost anything and held
until today and you guys would be up
almost anything unless like you were
buying
$hertz or you were buying um what else uh
$neo or all of these like meme stocks but
basically
but basically if you were buying a solid
quality company most likely you are up
in the markets and that's what i've been
doing all right
i've been using robinhood for a lot of
my trades and everything but today we're
going to be using a different brokerage
we're going to be using td ameritrade
if you guys don't know what that is
basically it's like the grown-up version
of robinhood so one last thing that i do
want to say about robinhood is that
they've been giving
they've been having a lot of issues in
2020 hopefully they fix a lot of the
issues because i like using the platform
but basically
um if you're not if you're not a
reliable brokerage like what's the
what's the point of having
my money in your in your accounts right
so today we'll be looking at td
ameritrade if you guys caught my last
video about hsas
i do recommend you guys go check that
video out because
there's a lot of advantages to having an
hsa and um i recently opened mind up
maxed it out and uh right now this is my
hsa account all right
um i open my hsa with lively and we are
sitting at
7071.76
so i'm editing the video right now and
one last thing i forgot to say is that i
do believe these are still growth
companies but i don't think that they're
going to double or triple in price in
the next
year or so but if you do keep them i'm
going to be keeping them longer and i do
think
maybe in the next five years they might
be able to double in price or something
like that
so if we take a look at my balance here
i made most of my deposits within the
last
month or so and these are the positions
that i bought and i'll be going over
each and every single one of them the
first
i bought one stock of $amazon
and i know i'm said one stock that's
because
one share $amazon cost over three
thousand dollars about one
stock of $google which cost one thousand
eight hundred dollars
over a hundred eight thousand dollars
and i bought ten shares
of $vti which is an uh $vanguard
total stock market index etf and um i
bought
current price right now is 191 shares
for each one of those
so taking a deeper dive into $amazon like
this
year has been the year for $amazon in my
opinion
you could say that for $tesla as well but
$amazon is like not that far behind here
with the pandemic this year buying
things online
has been so convenient i never have to
step into
like a supermarket or a convenience
store
if it's not an emergency and i can just
wait one or two days to get
whatever i need and $amazon has really
helped me along that way as well i'm
pretty sure you guys
are feeling the same way about $amazon
right now this year alone i probably
bought more stuff on $amazon than in the
last
five years combined so and i don't
really see this trend
slowing down anytime soon it's just a
better way
and a better experience when it comes to
buying regular everyday items now
and there's still a lot of growth
potential i believe with $amazon
even if the markets are at an all-time
high right now
i don't know if i mentioned this earlier
but um basically if you've been buying
stuff like me since march of 2020
anything that you bought since then
and if you held until today you would be
you would be
up on your investments like if we take a
look at my total
entire portfolio here my portfolio is
sitting at
140 000. so links are gonna be in the
description
for everything for your convenience you
guys don't have to jump around
and um if you guys want some free stocks
everything's gonna be down there so my
portfolio is sitting at almost 140 000
with an annual dividend income of 894
and if we scroll through this
if we scroll through this you see
nothing but gains here
i only have a few stocks that i'm still
holding that i'm down
and right here this is only a handful of
stocks well six so not
technically not a handful and uh my
lowest
worst performing stock right now is
$intel and $exxon mobil so like i said
earlier if you've been buying since
march
you would be doing pretty well in the
markets if you just bought and held
but now the the deals are getting a lot
harder to find
and so for me personally i'm looking for
something that will
at least hold this value and something
that
potentially can still grow and that's
like the combination that i'm looking
for at the moment
and i think these companies that i
bought $amazon $google
and you can't really say the same thing
for $vti but basically
$amazon and $google i believe they still
have a lot of growth potential
$amazon is one of those companies where i
always wanted to get in
but i always thought you know the price
is way too high
i'm just gonna wait for it to come back
down price is way too high i'm gonna
wait for it to come back down
and bam it's now the price is over three
thousand dollars so for me
i just personally needed to invest a
little bit more grow my position in it
and i'm gonna be dollar cost averaging
into $amazon
from here on out i have a bigger
position in my
td ameritrade brokerage but on my m1
finance as well
i still have a decent amount in there
about on my m1 finance account i own a
fractional share on there as well i own
about .368 shares
so if you guys are if you guys got like
a lot of money
you know td ameritrade they only do
whole shares but if you
if you don't have that much and you guys
want to buy fractional shares you know
you guys can buy $amazon on robinhood
or m1 finance so this is one of the big
reasons why i want to start
to invest in $amazon a little bit more a
little bit faster here
is because $amazon pharmacy this has been
in the news recently they just
started implementing the big pharma for
$amazon
over the last month or so and i think
this has been
in the in the works for a while but i
just wanted to see how it works and just
introduce to you
what it is so you can sign up for $amazon
pharmacy explore pricing options
and then you'll have your medication
delivered right to your door
just like any regular $amazon package
with the
with the pandemic thing still going on
and you know the
vaccine still not out yet i think this
i think this is going to be one of the
biggest potential income income streams
for $amazon in the future
and uh when it comes to big pharma you
know they got a lot of money that
industry is jam-packed
i own i own companies like $pfizer as
well and $johnson and johnson
those are big pharma companies and i
think $amazon is going to be a big player
in that role in the future
our promise to you our promise to you we
believe pharmacy can be better
with us you'll always know what to
expect our pricing is clear
understandable
medical information is protected you can
always speak to a pharmacist you'll
never worry about your medication you'll
never stand
in line at a pharmacy so that's one of
the big reasons why i bought $amazon
and you know $amazon at three thousand
dollars like this is the only stock that
i've ever this is the most expensive
stock that i ever bought or the highest
price stock that ever bought at 3 000
and i believe yes the market is
starting to look overvalued in my
opinion but still
this could potentially hold its value
and if it does drop i'll be buying more
$amazon
so let's move on to the next one so the
next company
on the list is $google and uh $google is
another one of those companies where
i just want to always get in always get
in but the price is just starts climbing
higher and higher and you always think
oh i'm just gonna wait for a pullback
same situation with $amazon as well so
you know i just bit the bullet
and i bought one share of $google it's
not gonna
you know it is at the high range the 52
weeks
range on the high end but still you know
$google
as a youtuber i got to um i got to
invest in the company that pays me
i believe so so when it comes to $google
you can actually buy
$alphabet class a shares or $alphabet
class c shares
and basically there's only one main
difference where
$google $g-o-o-g-l $alphabet a class shares
you can have voting rights
and and the $alphabet class c shares
there are no voting rights
so i've heard a lot of from other
investors saying that
the c class shares are better just
because you're paying a little bit of a
premium for the a class shares
and even if you do have voting rights
you're never going to really
change anything with um the amount of
voting power that you have unless you're
going to be buying like all the a class
shares
so it's probably better to just get to
see class shares
where that's probably the mistake that i
made where i bought the a class share so
i think that might be a better choice in
my opinion but um let's jump into some
of the reasons why i start i'm starting
to invest
in $google and the main reason why is
because of the youtube ad
revenues increased 30 from 3.8 billion
in the third quarter of
2019 this year including this quarter
showed
how valuable $google's founding product
search has been
to people so the main money maker right
now for $google
is their search so basically anytime
that you search for anything on $google
so let's say you wanted to look up lasik
surgery here
if you typed it in you look at basic
surgery and you see these ads this is
how $google
makes their money so companies pay
$google
to put their ads up here and uh look we
got one
two three four we got four ads for that
and you can just think of all the
different topics that you can have ad
placements on $google because
if you're not on the first page of
$google most likely you're never going to
be seen
when was the last time you went to page
10 of $google
and looked for something i've never i
pro it was probably like 15 to 20 years
ago when i did that
when i was like looking up stuff for uh
school if you know what i mean
and um even on page 10 you you're still
going to see these ads here
so this is the main money maker when it
comes to $alphabet
and now we have youtube ad revenue
so as a youtuber myself i started
calling myself a youtuber after i hit
100k
and this is one of the reasons why i
think
$google will still have some growth
potential they haven't
i believe they haven't really monetized
the the ad revenue from youtube
quite well and um yes you're seeing some
ads whenever you watch youtube videos
you probably might see one ad in
in the beginning of this video and one
ad in the middle of this video
and one ad at the end of this video
that's typically
like the normal way that they're doing
it now but we're just in the beginning
process of this they only just recently
started adding this
youtube ad revenue lately so as they get
more efficient with
ad placements and more brands and more
companies
want to place their ads on these youtube
videos
they're gonna make a lot more money
right that's one growth potential uh
they have right there so on top of that
i think there's going to be a big
migration
as well from people switching over from
cable cutting the cable plug and just
watching youtube
you there's youtube tv now um i i had
this for a while
$alphabet also has youtube tv i've used
this
uh for a few months i wasn't really a
big fan but
i know you know firsthand and personally
like i know a lot of
family and friends are using youtube tv
they've cut their cable cord already and
how
exclusively they're watching all their
channels and sports from
this service and i believe in the future
this has the potential to be one of the
biggest money makers as well for
$alphabet
including with uh youtube ad revenue so
going back
into um so going back into td ameritrade
here
$google right now is worth 1 819
a share today it's on the 52-week range
on the high end
so you guys have to be really cognizant
of that i i don't think
oh like i don't really like buying
companies at the high end
of the 52-week range but um
i still believe that $google will be able
to hold its value
even if like a correction comes um
eventually the price would go back to
this range i believe and um i will be
dollar cross averaging into $google in
the future as well and lastly
let's jump into $vti so
i was having a really difficult time
making this video just because
you know it's not as easy like before as
it was to
just buy stocks and say oh man
definitely this is undervalued this is
undervalued
it's just i just can't say that anymore
just because you know basically we
have returned back to uh the levels that
we've seen
pre uh pre-pandemic and um now
that's why i'm purchasing $vti i believe
you know buying an index is probably the
best thing for a beginner to do
it was uh how i first started to get
into investing in the stock market so
just going back to the fundamentals of
investing that's what i did that's what
i'm gonna do
every single time as well um you know if
you ask me personally like
if it's better for me to invest in
individual stocks or an etf i would say
etf
90 percent of the time just go with an
etf
all right so let's jump into some stats
here this is $vanguard total stock market
index fund etf shares $vti
um that's the share price up there at
the top so performance overview
17.10 year year-to-date total return
and if we look at some of the annual
total of return history here
the last time we saw a negative return
was
in uh 2018 before that was in 2008
37 basically um
down and 2002 which was 21 down but on
average
if we take all of this and average it up
i think um
let's look at here the last 10 years
has been a 14 average return
some of the best investors in the world
aka warren buffett says that
he would buy an index fund so why
wouldn't i want to buy an index fund
there's also space for all those yolo
investors as well why can't you do both
invest some money in the etf and invest
some money into your yolo trades you can
do both
there's there's no one saying that you
can't so so with that being said
for all of you guys that are just new to
investing just beware that
in december of 2020 there's this there's
typically a
like some type of sell-off just because
of tax
loss harvesting which is the selling of
securities at a loss to offset
capital gains tax liabilities and um
this happens every single year it's not
i'm pretty sure it's going to happen
this year as well so just be careful for
anybody that's just starting to invest
you guys really have to go through the
history and you know this is just coming
from experience this happened last year
as well and the year before that when i
was investing
and um if you guys are just new you guys
probably won't know this so
