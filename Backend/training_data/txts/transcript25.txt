what is up guys welcome back to another
video let's talk about
three different stocks three different
options plays that you guys should
definitely checking out and the first
one that we will talk about is gonna be
$carnival
$ccl this is $carnival cruise lines and in
the past month it's been doing pretty
well
past three months pretty phenomenal in
the past year it's been extremely choppy
but it's finally going from just
mere 12 bucks now it's at 28 but 28
is still really far away from the
$carnival floor value of 41
$carnival every time when it dips to the
low 40s it bounces all the way back up
to the 50s
and $carnival's at 28 it's still down
45 from their regular peak
and $carnival recently isn't really doing
so hot because you got a lot of
restrictions on them
especially how the bookings have surged
that's a good thing
but the fleet isn't moving and that's
because the cdc essentially
halting $carnival cruises and you even
got like other cruise liners completely
cancelling these summer vacation spots
they're done i mean you can't really get
any bookings
i mean cdc is just shutting it down but
here's the thing
because of that it makes $carnival
cruises a really good buying opportunity
and since it's still roughly 45 from the
pre
pandemic price and with airlines already
recovering to
like their original price tags because
obviously airlines are like fully opened
up
cruises are the last vacation industry
that hasn't fully opened up because
cruises haven't actually fully opened up
it's really great to start buying some
long calls for $carnival cruises now i
don't recommend
anything super short term what i
recommend is january 21st 2022
if you're gonna get pretty risky i
highly suggest a 45 dollar strike price
which only costs 185 dollars
the implied volatility is super low at
57 percent
and the open interest is exceptionally
high with a very tiny volume now the
open interest is the amount of call
contracts
in people's brokerage accounts and
that's a lot of contracts
being held in several individuals
accounts now the volume is super low at
24
meaning that the majority of individuals
that are
buying $ccl options that expire january
21st 2022 for the 45
strike price they don't plan on selling
this contract anytime
soon there's less volume no one is
really selling
the people who bought have already
bought their fair shares they're done
and they're just gonna be holding on to
these contracts as long as they can
and this is exactly doing meaning
there's a lot of people getting pretty
bullish on cruises if you guys
are really sad that you missed out on
like the airplane rally
like $american airlines $delta $southwest
airlines stuff like that and they're
really bummed out $carnival cruises
$royal caribbean $norwegian are probably
one of your best bets
because these guys are still very low
from the original price tag i think
$carnival could easily be worth
at the very least 40 dollars in a normal
price
of 50. right now it's 28 so you're still
looking at some massive gains now i
don't recommend monthlies and don't
recommend weeklies what i recommend
is just dragging it down six to eight
months that way
when it slowly opens up maybe in the
summertime in the fall because in the
fall time we will be having a lot of
people vaccinated
and also my university is already
opening their doors to have
in-class meetings i think $carnival and
also a lot of these cruise liners will
get the restrictions lifted off
and therefore would be very very good
for them and the second side we will
talk about is $teledoc health
now $teledoc health is a really big
company if you guys don't know what it
is essentially you can meet up with your
doctor
or primary care physician online instead
of going to the clinics
if it's something that's not super
serious and they could diagnose you
over the webcam they'll give you like a
prescription then you go on $amazon blah
blah blah and they'll send you a
prescription by mail
or let's say you have a kid and he or
she has a sore throat you could just
talk to a primary care physician
and it's just so much more simpler than
just going to the clinic
and therefore you do have $mckinsey which
is this massive
research firm they estimate that after
the pandemic the
tele health community and also industry
will be making roughly 200 billion
dollars per year and that's a lot of
money if you look at $teledoc health
right here the market cap is only 28
billion dollars
and part of the reason why it dropped
from almost 300 down to 185
is because one the tech industry was
going up way too much
and two $amazon is coming out of their
own telehealth industry
which really freaked out $teledoc health
as investors but just keep in mind that
$amazon yes it's a pretty big company but
with the market being so big like 250
billion dollars per year after the
pandemic
i could pretty much guarantee you that
$teledoc health will be going up
especially at 185
is the perfect floor value if you guys
are kind of afraid if $tdoc stock could
keep going down
the chances aren't really high now
obviously what i recommend is probably
may 21st
or possibly july 16th
long calls and the reason why long costs
for a $teledoc health in $carnival
and not weeklies or monthlies is a
short-term gains
or i'm not sure of i'm not really sure
if in the next two months if the stock
has stayed up or down by
no in the long term six to 12 months
the general trend will go up a lot of
these meme stocks you just need
one good piece of information and the
stock will rally up for
weeks and therefore your leaps will make
so much money
even though previously there aren't
really making that much money and you're
fine if we bought
weeklies and essentially we're betting
that stock will go up in the next couple
weeks
and if it doesn't which it probably
might not well you're going to be losing
our money if you buy leaps and the stock
doesn't go up you're going to be losing
just a little bit of money just simply
from the time decay
but overall the markets go up you should
be able to make a lot of money and last
but not least we gotta talk about $uber i
think $uber has a very good floor value
of roughly 52 dollars and a resistance
point of 60
therefore making it a really really good
stock to play the iron condor with
let's go to trade $uber options here
let's drag this out by one week
and let's just make an iron condor for
$uber let's sell a put for
the 53.5 and buy a
put right beneath that and let's sell it
put right now
i don't really think go above 60 and
then you buy put right above that click
continue
click one review the order so you have
to put down a collateral of 50
but you get a minimum credit of 14.
essentially you make roughly 28
just by holding on to the spread and
winning it for a week and a few more
trading days
which really isn't that bad 28 for a
week and a half
that's okay here's the deal you got to
lock down a collateral 50 bucks that's
your money locked in but you get 14
right away so the trade goes against you
you will lose roughly 36 dollars that's
not that
bad turning 36 to 50 dollars and
essentially you just want this $uber
stock to
be in between your two cells in between
your cell call and between your sell
puts
so right now $uber stock is at roughly 57
and our cell call is 60. now you don't
want $uber to be above 60
around expiration day remember you won't
be seeing max gains until the last day
our expiration is 4 pm april 16th make
sure to close it at 3 59 pm april 16th
if you don't you run the risk of
assignment these are some of the most
dangerous option strategies but that's
only if you
don't close it be responsible and close
your iron condors and your spreads
before the official expiration time in
day so about 3 59 pm if it's
below 60 congratulations you get
your collateral back of 50 but for every
penny above 60
will be a full dollar knocked off for
collateral until it's above
sixty dollars and fifty cents and you
lose your fifty bucks and same thing
down here
you don't want the stock to drop that
much either you wanna stay
between fifty three dollars and fifty
cents and sixty dollars
so here's how it goes you have three
dollars and five cents at your cell
phone you want it to stay above that but
not go above 60 our cell call
so if it goes below this essentially
every penny below 53
and 50 cents will be a dollar knocked
off for collateral
until it goes below 53 and then you lose
all of your money
and that's how it goes this is the power
of iron condors as long as it fluctuates
between those two prices
you're okay now $uber stock obviously
likes to hover between 52
and also 58 so this spread has an
extremely high chance of winning
and this is how you can make some nice
consistent weekly income that's about it
