everybody welcome back to the channel my
name is pauline guma
founder of pedology lab in today's video
i'm going to be sharing with you the top
three stocks for today
and why you should keep them on your
watch list all right and i'm also going
to be answering some of you guys
questions for those of y'all who dropped
your stocks of interest in the comments
section of last night's video
right after the intro
[Music]
all right y'all right off the bat um the
market unfortunately
gave that give up all of its gains all
right it's really really unfortunate
let me show you what happened throughout
last night
so last night market was looking good
until they formed
a head and shoulders obviously a very
bearish
pattern it happened overnight nobody
could have seen it the neckline over
here broke
and then it immediately tanked all right
i'm not surprised now that i
see it but it it would have been nice if
this happened during trading hours that
way you would know
but hey some things happen and that's
all right um right now where are my
stands
on the market again just go right back
down to
these previous laws right now um i would
say
i would say be very very careful all
right um
seeing this i cannot i cannot be
um i cannot be fully how do i say that i
cannot be fully confident that we're
gonna go all the way back up again like
today
all right i can't i can't just tell you
guys that what i can tell you is to
manage your risk
right and to trade with caution because
if it doesn't go
anywhere over here let's say today just
consolidates
and then tomorrow if this line right
here
breaks if this line right here breaks
then we could be heading lower
another way that we can look at this is
the let's check out the
one yeah
the one hour is also not looking too
great and if that line right here
activate right over here
if that line breaks we're not we're not
in good shape
okay so as of right now again switch to
seek day trading opportunities day
trading opportunities or
continue continue shorting so let's get
into the uh
let's get into the top three stocks and
what i mean by continue shorting i'm
going i'm talking about
$viac that's the number one stock for
today all right
and $viac this is an opportunity for us
to
re-short right yesterday i showed you
all my trades
on it about how i got in here here
here right and then sold everything near
these bottoms right there what i forgot
to tell you guys
is that in the morning if y'all can see
this one right here
this was a buy i bought this one like
right at the open yesterday morning two
contracts over here and then i
added another one two minutes later so i
am still holding three
again i sold the previous eight and i
still have three there that i'm still
holding right and as of right now
things are looking pretty good for me to
want to add
um the stock is still looking weak and
the stock is still looking very very
elevated
right and it's about to open at like 90
bucks um best case scenario it tries to
like make a move back up to like 91
and then immediately tanks again that's
that's
really if the market collapses as a
whole this one will tank
even harder all right so um
keep this one on your watches for sure
for today for a continuation
for those of y'all who still held those
foots again you're still in good shape
like those contracts if you bought the
92 you need any four dollar but you're
still in good shape
um but just watch this one for a
continuation down
um if you're looking to be a little bit
more aggressive just keep in mind that
we're still at the top
and there's a lot more room to go down
all right
so that's the first one the next one
that all of you should be keeping on
your watch list
for sure that stock is
$disco all right and this cup
this guy is also good for a short um
$disca
tanked along with the $vi ac yesterday
right it tried to get into this
circle right here i wanted it to go much
much higher towards 80 bucks
but it just could not make it and it
immediately faded down and right now the
situation is looking
pretty good for short sellers it's
looking pretty good it's not i don't
think it's gonna make it so
keep that one on your watches for a
potential short as well
towards the 67 68
region it may even go lower again keep
in mind
the stock is it had a spread and people
are going to take their money off the
table
and also if that floor breaks on the spy
that i just showed y'all
if that breaks everything is gonna take
literally
everything is going to take so uh manage
your risk and seek day trading
opportunities right the market is
playing games
and i'm not a fan of that now the third
stock that all of you should be keeping
on your watch list that stock is $$ual
all right despite the fact that the
market is looking a bit weird
and in fact it's looking kind of bearish
right now $ual
is still holding strong i think it may
pull back towards like 61.50
and provide a buying opportunity before
rebounds
um airlines are doing are doing pretty
well right now
um regardless of what the overall market
is doing
a money was to keep flooding in here i
don't think the money is done
yet so in regards to this one if it dips
to 61 or the 61 and a half um
i will be looking to buy that dip for a
continuation to the upside i'm not there
i showed airlines
as of right now it had a good move but i
just don't think that the top
is in yet and i do think that it can go
a lot higher
so just keep these ones on your watches
again i provided two for the shorts
and then one for the long right but
again for the long you have to be
patient because again like i said
the market is playing games which is not
very which is not very nice all right
so there's my thoughts on those now
let's talk about you guys stocks of
interest the very first one that we're
going to be covering
that stock is $tesla of course $tesla
did not explode in the direction that we
wanted which is uh
which which is super activated again
when the market tanks
everything changed the head and
shoulders on there was too clean that i
showed you out on the spy
and everything tinked as well all right
will this level hold
we want to we wanted to old right we
wanted to just consolidate over here
and then uh on friday we will see what
it does
it's still inside the flag so i'm not
too worried about it
it's still inside it so we just have to
wait just a little bit longer to see
what it does
could we see a double bottom is a
possibility if it takes below that level
again brace yourselves
um but i i honestly i think it's just
gonna consolidate over here
um and i do i i want to see exactly how
it behaves let's say the market really
really really takes
all right if it stays in here throughout
any chaos that may happen
then it's a good sign all right but for
now i would just tell you just be
patient with $tesla
the market is playing games the next one
that we're going to be talking about
is $baba and $baba i mentioned this one i
think it was
the for the past two days um i told
y'all
to watch this thing for a reversal um i
also give y'all
this um warning that it could drop
towards 293
to 94 but it didn't get there it
immediately just consolidated that
support
and spiked right out the gates should
you
chase this thing as of right now
honestly
um the same device for this one applies
for the same advice but $ual applies for
this one again not financial advice
though
not financial advice i would say wait
for the dip i think you can drop back
down to 235
or 234 and then consolidate before
continuing back up again
um given the fact that it's been beaten
down for
quite some time but right now it's still
trying to make that recovery to the
upside
there's also a bullish engulfing candle
over here all right so just
just keep that in mind either
consolidation
before we go up all right so just watch
out for those
all right now the
next one that we should talk about in
this video that's like $his dish
$the ish let's see how this is doing
and $this dish is doing quite well
i featured this one a while ago i think
it was this weekend
um this stock is about to break out i
think that was the title of that video
um the video was released at 37 right
now
this is at 39
is holding quite strongly all right
and this one is a hold before me
all right i think i do think it's gonna
get all the way in here to 41
unless it tries to rip unless it tries
to retest that level
of that neckline before going back up
and getting there
late all right that could also happen
keep that in mind and do not be
surprised if that actually does happen
and it could be late all right i'm just
like um
ko was like $kale was very very
frustrating i featured this one a long
time ago
to watch the thing for move up to 53
dollars it didn't get there until a week
later
again this is what i'm talking about if
you're a beginner and
you see this thing happening like right
after the video just don't be surprised
i'm literally showing you what could
happen
um with uh with $dish
all right so yeah these are these are
just my thoughts today
again be very careful day trading is a
priority
swing trading a little risky and manage
your risk that is the end of the video
