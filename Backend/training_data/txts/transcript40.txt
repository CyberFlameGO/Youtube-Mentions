what's another stock you're looking into
in april
i might make a video on that in the
future first let's do a quick update on
some of our recent plays before we dive
into the top three stocks for april 2021
first is $copen ticker symbol $k-o-p-n
we've been swooping up shares
every time it got close to the eight
dollar mark and then it very quickly ran
up to all the way to eleven dollars i
think $coping is still a very great pick
and shovel play i'm gonna continuously
add more and more shares
when it starts hitting that eight
dollars again i think especially
with the $microsoft hololens contract
with the us army to supply them with
120 000 goggles it definitely makes ar
and vr goggles even more mainstream
if you can consider the us army
mainstream next is an update on $carnival
i recently took some profits
i originally bought in with a cost basis
of around eight dollars and given all
the hype around recovery stocks as well
as cruise lines starting to set sail
again
as well as an upcoming earnings say i
thought this was a really great time to
take some profit
because i do think $carnival is pretty
much overvalued
given it's very close to its pre-coveted
levels
plus it also added a ton of new debt
onto its balance sheet
next up some catalysts and swing plays
from our daily market reports
i talked about two takers $ltrpb where i
ran from forty dollars at the time of
posting all the way to
above eighty dollars on the other hand
for $pfin $pfin
um unfortunately this one didn't run too
much i think it was maybe up one or two
percent after i posted that swing trade
but these are the plays that you want to
get in and out very quickly because
these are purely just driven off of
catalyst and not based off extensive due
diligence so if you want more alerts
like this
my buy and sell alerts my daily market
reports where i talk about updates every
single morning
on price targets some catalyst runners
as well as the current events
a weekly watch list my private portfolio
and join a community of informed
investors make sure you check out the
patreon the first link down below
and now is the perfect time to join
because we just started april a brand
new month and we are welcoming everyone
with
brand new open arms now let's get into
the top three stocks for april and the
first one
is going to be $palantir take your symbol
$pltr
and the reason for this is we recently
received some really positive news
as well as a short-term catalyst on the
horizon it makes you say until the end
to
hear what my entry price target is now
$palancier has been beaten
bruised and battered the past couple of
weeks very similar to battered fried
chicken
and this is largely because of the very
rapidly increasing 10-year treasury
yield
now despite the constant push-down and
market abuse it does seem like $palantir
is forming a very very steady support
level
at the low 20 dollars and we can
constantly see being bumped onto support
line and now after solidifying the
support level i think it
presents a very nice buying opportunity
if you are planning to hold for the long
term
and yes there is no doubt in my mind
that the evaluation is very richly
valued and some might say even
overvalued but there's a ton
of future potential pent-up and $pounds
here you know how a lot of people are
saying
data is the new oil well po$unds here is
pretty much venezuela plus saudi arabia
combined
now onto some of the good news it
recently won a contract with the nuclear
security administration
for a five-year contract of 89.9 million
dollars now bears i know what you're
thinking if we actually divide this
contract up by the five years
the per year amount is actually not a
significant amount
relative to $$pound tier size and yes i
100
agree however i don't think the actual
dollar amount of this contract is the
paramount
aspect of this entire deal i think the
fact that they're continuously signing
more and more customers is more
important it's another government agency
whether it be military and intelligence
it just speaks to the volume of the
technological capacity that $palutear has
as a platform now i'll give you bears
this i do
want to see $$pound tier expand their
customer base
and focus more on private companies
right now there is a very large
concentration of their customers
within government agencies i do want to
see them expanding
into more commercial spaces they
recently started with aws
as well as $ibm this that's really great
news i want to see them expand even more
secondly if you check out their most
recent 8k filing on april 1st
there's actually some really positive
news as well as some speculation that we
can make the first one
is that $pounds here pre-paid all of
their outstanding term loans
under their credit agreement value up to
200 million dollars
and this is credit from major
institutions such as morgan stanley as
well as credit suisse now what's even
better
is that these institutions decide to
increase the line of credit that they
could potentially extend to $$pound tier
from 200 million all the way up to 400
million so basically doubling that
amount
and these are two banks and institutions
actually set price targets as well as
analyst ratings for $pounds here by the
way this website is called tip ranks
where you can easily see some analyst
price targets et cetera
if you do want to explore this website i
have a referral link in the description
down below
now this is where i say it's going to be
extrapolation because yes i understand
these institutions have different teams
setting the price targets versus
extending these credit lines however it
is relatively bullish to have the credit
team see $pounds here as a strong enough
company
to double their line of credits and
again pure speculation then potentially
these analysts might also have more of a
bullish sentiment
on $pounds here and maybe potentially
upgrade their price targets
again pure speculation now the short
term catalyst i am talking about
is happening on april 14th and this is
the double click demo day event
eventually it's event to show off the
powers and capabilities of palletery
foundry
in life sciences as well as the
industrial sector
now in terms of an entry price target it
recently ran up to 23
24 um there is a very solid support at
the 20
level i honestly think that at this
level the 2324 is a pretty good
entry price but if you want to play even
safer um potentially wait until it drops
down to 21
22 now moving on to the next stock and
that is
$coinbase i'm just kidding can you
imagine now i am mentioning $coinbase
because that is
a segue into one of the stocks but
essentially $coinbase if you didn't know
is going ipo on april 14th
with a whopping valuation of 100 billion
dollars
if you thought $pound here was overvalued
with a price of sales ratio of
everything i think in the 30s
$coin basis valuation puts them at a
price to sales ratio
multiple of i think in the mid 70s and
this is where i'm trying to get it on
the bright side if you are looking for
entering into the realm of crypto
brokerage exchange there already is a
company that's already public
as on otc and is growing very rapidly
and even outpacing the growth of
$coinbase
and that's called $$voyager digital ticker
symbol $v y g
v f now i already made a video on
$voyager i think on march 22nd when the
stock price was around 24
recently ran up to 29 uh we at the
discord we got in around 15 to 16
so we already made some really healthy
gains but i still
think $voyager has more room to run
especially as we run up with the
anticipation of this $coinbase ipo
the reason because i think people are
going to start fomo'ing they're going to
start looking at other
crypto brokerage platform exchanges
that's available on the market today
they want to get in on the next hottest
craze and they might be scared at the
valuation of $coinbase
or the price per share of $coinbase and
they're gonna look for the next
thing and a lot of articles on reddit or
a lot of stock forum discussions
are saying that $voyager is pretty much a
really solid alternative to $coinbase
and this sentiment is becoming more and
more popular trust me guys
if you don't believe me you can pause
this video just click that pause click
on the screen
and do some google searches okay now
that you unpause
um i'm assuming you already did the
google search and now you're back
anyways it does make sense because
$voyager has a lot of pluses compared to
$coinbase oneplus
is the fact that $voyager is a crypto
brokerage meaning they
offer 12 exchanges versus $coinbase is
in exchange on its own so if $coinbase as
an exchange goes down
and you're a $coinbase user you can't
make any more trades on the flip side
with
$voyager brokerage platform if one
exchange goes down you have 11 other
exchanges that you can work with
plus with $voyager you can get the best
rate out of those 12
exchanges automatically another plus is
that $voyager's growth
is pretty unprecedented it's one of the
fastest growing crypto brokerages
exchanges in the entire world right now
seriously the growth is absolutely
insane december 2020
the revenue was 1.7 million dollars
january 2021
8.6 million dollars february 2021
20 million dollars these are month over
month increases
and it's expected by q1 of 2021
it's gonna face a nine thousand nine
thousand with three zeros
percent increase in revenue year over
year now i personally wouldn't enter at
this current level
right now at the 29 mark it just entered
oversold territory on the rsi
i'm personally going to be waiting for a
pullback into the lower 20s before i
start adding to my position
now i did make a high-level video on
$voyager check out this video over here
for more details
but you should definitely do your own
due diligence on this one because it is
an otc stock
so it's inherently more risky plus just
a quick plug if you want an even more
detailed research report check out the
discord and patreon where i post my full
research reports
before these videos even come out now on
to the third stock this is more of a
blue chip slash recovery play
and i'm sure you've heard it before it's
worldwide over 200 countries
it's called $visa ticker symbol $v now the
price dropped from 228 dollars
all the way down to 205 i think around
two fridays ago
because of an anti-trust doj probe that
was announced
introducing a lot of short-term
volatility pretty much immediately after
that happened i made a couple videos
saying that $visa was a great buying
opportunity i picked up a couple of
shares of $visas are a dollar cost
averaging into it
and more recently it's around 218
dollars and 219 dollars so it already
ran up from 205 to 219.
now in terms of an entry price target i
think still anything under 220
is a pretty good level um i think this
is a really solid blue chip recovery
play
for a couple of reasons first one is
that $visa is pretty much recession
resistant
and i don't think we're entering
recession anytime soon
but it's still good to have that in your
portfolio
for example if we check out the 0809
recession we can actually look into the
business financials of $visa and the
revenues the ebitda their earnings
all increase pretty substantially during
that recession
now if we talk about the stock price the
stock price did drop but it dropped less
than the $s p 500
and recovered a lot quicker than the $s p
500 did
secondly it's a recovery play because
$visa
is a payment processor meaning every
time you use your credit card your debit
card
that is partnered with $visa $visa gets a
portion of that as a transaction revenue
and you can imagine as economies reopen
not only in the united states but
throughout the rest of the world because
$visa operates in over 200 countries more
people are going to go shopping again
more people are going to have work
people are going to start buying things
going to the store
swiping with their plastics etc etc and
$visa
gets a small portion of all of those
transactions so therefore $visa is not
only a good safe haven but it's also a
recovery play now there are more stocks
that i'm looking into in april 2021
um that's not going to fit into this
video i might make an updated video next
week or the week afterwards
or you can very quickly check out these
research reports by joining discord in
the patreon
but as always unfortunately i do have to
give you another homework of the day
i don't i take no joy in giving you guys
this but the homework is to post some
other tickers
that you're looking into in april 2021 i
might make a video on them
in the future in the meantime why don't
