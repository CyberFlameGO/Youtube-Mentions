hey what's up guys welcome back to my
world of stocks
now the stock market as you guys know
has been a bit shaky in recent weeks and
personally i still think it's a bit too
high
but i gotta admit there are quite a few
stocks out there that are looking very
attractive
so a lot of stocks in correction right
now meaning they're down well over 10
from their highs and that got me
thinking what are some good stocks
to be purchasing right now on any dips
i've got four stocks in particular for
you guys today
all of these stocks are down from
anywhere from like 15
to 30 percent from their high so these
are some pretty big dips
and uh i think these are great long-term
stocks so i went ahead and picked out
four stocks that i really want to buy
already at these prices and there's a
one that is going to be a value dividend
play
another one is going to be a growth
stock uh
third one will be a foreign stock and
then we've got a core
foundational stock so we've got a bit of
variety in there as well
so should be a lot of fun i hope you
guys enjoy this video let me know what
you think down below
hit the like button if you enjoy the
video really helps the channel let's go
ahead and jump straight into this
okay now kicking things off here let's
start with our value dividend stock and
for this one i chose the pharmaceutical
giant $$merck ticker symbol $mrk
and uh this is a stock that up until
2020 was performing pretty well but
has since dropped by around 18 from that
high
now there's a lot of reasons for that
like fears of drug price reform as well
as
a down year in profits last year for
them but this is still a very solid
company profits are usually in the
billions while
sales are in the tens of billions with
this year in particular expected to be
a rebound of almost 10 growth in
revenues
while both this year and the next are
also expected to see double-digit growth
for their profits as well
meanwhile they have what many predict
will be the best-selling drug in the
next couple of years
in kittruda which is estimated to
generate a massive
over 22 billion dollars all on its own
by 2025
which is about half of all the sales
that $$merck brought in
as an entire company last year and it
doesn't even lose pan protection until
i think around 2028 so plenty of years
to keep raking in huge amounts of money
and even when it does lose that
protection $$merck is already working on a
robust pipeline to offset the declines
in the future
which includes various treatments for
things like cancers various illnesses
and
even the pepperoni and yet because the
stock is trading so low their forward p
ratio is actually close to 60 percent
cheaper than the rest of the sector
leaving them with a very nice dividend
of over 3.5 percent
on a low payout ratio of only around 40
percent
and 11 years of consecutive growth add
it all up and
$$merck is looking really good to me right
now so uh i actually went ahead and just
started picking them up and started
buying into the stock today actually
uh i am actually very happy to add this
one to my
dividend uh portion of my portfolio by
the way warren buffett recently
purchased this one as well and i gotta
say i agree with
his decision there okay now next up here
let's jump into
our growth pick and for this one gotta
go with
with one of my absolute favorite long
term tech plays
in $nvidia ticker symbol $nvda now when
looking at the stock
they saw a huge surge in 2020 but are
now starting to correct a little
with the stock recently dropping about
25
from their high i'll just tell you guys
right now i went ahead and bought some
more shares earlier today as well
because i really i'm really liking this
dip on $nvidia now don't be full though
into thinking that this is all of a
sudden a cheap stock
$nvidia is still very expensive at a 4p
ratio
of 36 but there are plenty of reasons to
think that they will eventually grow
into that valuation over time for one
actually think $nvidia's biggest growth
will come years from now in the future
and yet we are
already really seeing them start to put
up impressive numbers
this year both their sales and their
profits
are expected to climb by over 30 percent
and that's despite them having
already climbed by over 50 percent the
year before that as well
but the reason why i think that the
larger growth is actually still to come
is because $nvidia operates in very large
markets that
i think will be the foundation of almost
everything that goes on in the future
and
$nvidia i think will be powering most of
them with their high performance
processing chips
as well as their various platforms and
software's for example in the data
center market
$nvidia estimates that their total
addressable market will surpass
a hundred billion dollars in just a few
years from now
for context their data center revenue
was less than 7 billion last year
and that was even after 124 growth year
over year
so just imagine all the potential for
even more growth that is still on the
table
especially when you consider their new
class of processors called dpus
that are insanely more efficient than
cpus and a couple of blockbuster
acquisitions in melanox and arm
that will help their products and
services expand to literally
trillions of devices worldwide not to
mention other areas for growth as well
like
for example gaming where literally
billions of gamers worldwide
will keep demanding that the market
produce the most kind of lifelike gaming
experiences possible
i think $nvidia will continue to play
perhaps the biggest role in that
as they lead the way in virtually all
new graphical gaming technologies
like ray tracing artificial intelligence
and advanced shading
now there's also the electric vehicle
market that will soon be overtaking
traditional gas vehicles
as more legacy automakers try to
desperately fend off
$tesla but if there's one thing that we
can all agree on here
it's that the legacy players will need
robust autonomous driving platforms
if they ever dream to compete with the
likes of $tesla and one of the easiest
and kind of fastest ways to do that
i've said this many times before before
is to hire a third-party company like
$nvidia to actually do it for them
who already has close to 400 different
partners and finally i think that the
most overlooked and
kind of future growth driver for $nvidia
will
actually be the internet of things and
smart cities
all of which can be powered in some way
by $nvidia as our populations keep
growing and many large cities struggle
to fit all
of the people in there the fact of the
matter
is that we're gonna have to learn how to
run cities more intelligently and more
efficiently
and that's exactly what $nvidia's
metropolis platform has
already been working on for years they
use artificial intelligence and deep
learning
to improve public safety traffic
management and resource
optimization i think that market is
going to blow up huge over the next
couple decades and well into the future
and it's going to require a lot of
platforms and sensors and hardware and
software and
a ton of data to really be processed
very quickly and efficiently and i think
$nvidia has one of the best shots of
leading the way in that market so
i'll gladly buy $nvidia now at higher
prices for the exciting future that i
think they're gonna have
okay now moving on to stock number three
that's going to be
our foreign stock and really this one
could easily count as another growth
stock as well like similar to $nvidia
but that's going to be the chinese
e-commerce giant in $alibaba ticker
symbol $b-a-b-a no not a huge surprise
i've talked about them a lot in the past
but this is also a stock that i do
already own myself and
i would love to buy some more on this
dip here speaking of which up until
recently the stock was performing
extremely well before
finally taking a dip over the past
couple months as they are now down about
30 from their highs at the time of this
recording
there's several reasons for this for one
chinese regulators
halted the ipo of $alibaba's largest
spin-off company called
ant group who is famous for their alipay
service that holds over
1.3 billion users worldwide which
for context is about three to four times
larger than paypal
and after delaying that ipo and forcing
them to
make changes to their business china
went on to launch an anti-trust probe
against $alibaba
which spooked investors in case you guys
don't know what that means it's
basically when a company gets too large
sometimes
the government will investigate them and
try to kind of put stricter regulations
on them so that
they don't they can't really act like a
big monopoly and do
shady things that will make it
impossible for smaller companies to
compete with them
anyway there was also a u.s ban on
certain chinese stocks
although it was later revealed that
$alibaba would not be included on that
list at least for now
but because $alibaba is one of the most
heavily invested in
chinese companies in the united states
investors got scared that a huge portion
of its
investor base would be forced to sell
and that coupled with all of those other
issues just
really added up to a big drop in the
stock price at a time when most other
tech companies especially e-commerce
ones have really been soaring because of
the
pepperoni lockdowns where everyone's
been using like all of their services
now those that are bullish on $alibaba
though myself included
feel that now that a lot of this like
negativity is being priced into the
stock
this could turn out to be one heck of a
buying opportunity for the long term now
just to be clear i don't ever buy too
much of an amount of like foreign stocks
especially chinese ones because
of all the risks that they carry which
i've discussed in previous videos but if
you're able to look past that
and accept the risk you know there's
actually a lot to like about $alibaba
stock
for one the stock is trading with a
forward p ratio of less than
20 and a peg ratio of less than one
yet when you look at their financials
the company performs
similarly to $amazon with unbelievable
growth for their
already gigantic size this year they're
expected to do
over a hundred billion dollars in
revenue and that's still with growth of
over
40 percent i mean what other company out
there has the valuation of $alibaba
and still puts up these kind of numbers
and it's not like they're not
profitable or like there's something
seriously wrong with their business in
fact
they're very profitable with over 25
billion dollars in free cash flow
over just the past 12 months and all of
this is in u.s dollars by the way not
like chinese yuan
now if you want to know how $alibaba is
doing this all you really have to do
is read this new report from emarketer
that just came out recently
where they estimate that china will
become the first country in the world to
have their e-commerce market
make up over 50 of all their retail
sales no other country in the world
even comes close south korea in second
place doesn't even reach
30 percent when you look at the united
states they're only at a measly 15
by comparison to give you some more
context china's e-commerce market is
expected
to grow by 21 this year as it approaches
3
trillion dollars in sales which is like
more than three times
larger than even the united states
that's pretty crazy
and of course $alibaba dominates most of
this market at over 50
percent market share the next closest is
$jd.com
it's only at about 15 by the way
emarketer also specifically mentions the
global health issue
and the resulting lockdowns as something
that has really pushed online sales even
further
and they note that online grocery
shopping has really surged recently
and that may be a change that is here to
stay well guests who just
increased their stake by literally
billions of dollars in one of china's
largest hyper market and supermarket
companies that operates close to 500
individual stores
yep $alibaba did and that's going to
dramatically increase their footprint
across the country
making it even easier to implement
online grocery shopping
among other things then you add on their
largest market share in cloud computing
in the asia region
and all kinds of other projects in
artificial intelligence gaming and even
electric vehicles and you're talking
about a massive company that isn't
going anywhere the risk to investors is
that because it's a chinese company
we can basically get screwed at any
moment as investors
or i should say as like foreign
investors but for me the stock is just
too attractive to ignore
and especially the further drops i
really like it here
even with the added risk again i i know
chinese stocks are controversial i'm not
saying
you know there's even ethical issues and
all kinds of stuff but
in terms of just looking at it
objectively as a stock i gotta say it's
really an attractive one
okay now finally we are down to our core
foundational stock a stock that
one could theoretically build like an
entire portfolio around because of its
massive size profitability solid
business and
overall reliability and right now i
gotta say the social media giant's
$facebook ticker symbol $fb is looking
pretty damn attractive
now they've always been a pretty decent
performer and uh they especially had a
very strong
2020 leaving them up over a hundred and
forty percent in the past five years
but they've also been known to go
through a few dips once in a while
and the last few weeks have been no
exception they're currently down about
15 from their high that's good news
though to any $facebook bulls out there
because it leaves one of the biggest
companies in the world with actually a
very attractive valuation
at a pg ratio of less than one for
context that's cheaper than any of the
giant fang stocks
including $microsoft so like $amazon $apple
$netflix $google $microsoft
$facebook beats all of them on value
based on that pg ratio
and yet it's not like $facebook is a
dying company or you know kind of
struggling to grow or anything like that
in fact
they could easily be considered the
third growth stock on
today's list despite their already
massive size sales are expected to
surpass a hundred billion dollars this
year
and yet they continue to put up growth
rates of over 20 percent that is insane
of course a ton of that growth is sadly
thanks to the pepperoni lockdowns as
people are
kind of stuck at home and spending so
much time on their phones and on
social media but for $facebook it's now
giving them over three
billion monthly active users on at least
one of their several apps like $facebook
instagram messenger
or whatsapp that's getting pretty close
to half of the entire world's population
which companies can directly advertise
to by paying $facebook a fee and
as long as $facebook's apps stay relevant
the money will keep pouring in because
these advertisers love the fact that
they can
target directly to any audience they
want since $facebook basically knows
everything about you at this point
whether that's ethically good or bad
it's just the reality that we live in
right now
now admittedly i've always been hesitant
to buy $facebook myself because
i feel like people are getting pretty
bored of $facebook itself like
$facebook.com
i actually never even use it myself but
instagram on the other hand has been
on fire for years and continues to grow
larger
check out this chart here from pew
research showing social media platforms
you can see that $facebook kind of
flattened out there in recent years but
instagram
completely took off and left all the
other competition behind in terms of
growth
although admittedly tech talk has
probably been seen like much higher
growth but
they're not included on this list
because i think it went a little far
back uh either way though
i really don't think instagram is going
anywhere because they have a huge young
user base
in fact 72 of all teens say they use
instagram
and 73 of them say that it's the best
way for brands to reach them about new
products that's pretty crazy
because of that it's estimated that over
75
of all u.s businesses are already on
instagram and according to smartly
around 65 of all social media ad dollars
are spent on either $facebook or
instagram so as long as $facebook can
stay relevant as a company and either
keep their apps popular or introduce new
ones they'll likely continue to dominate
that's a very real possibility and
especially in terms of
making new ones considering that they
have so much cash to spend on virtually
anything they want
operating cash flow was nearly 40
billion dollars last year alone and
one of the absolute they have one of the
best uh absolute best balance sheets in
the world right now
at over 75 billion dollars in current
assets
that's more than double all of their
liabilities combined
and they have a current and total ratio
of both above
five that's like that's very very high
in case you're not familiar
with those ratios you want to be above
one but being above five that's crazy
add it all up and really i think uh the
only threat to $facebook's dominance will
be
like anti-trust regulations from the
government if they try to like break
them up or put other restrictions on
them but
even then at today's valuation it's
still pretty attractive even if
some of that stuff ends up happening
even if they were getting like split up
or different things
anyway those are the stocks that i'd
like to keep at the very top of my watch
list right now
sucks that i want to purchase uh $nvidia
and $merc
actually already started purchasing
today and then uh $alibaba and $facebook
still kind of
considering it $alibaba is a stock that i
do already own it is a big position so
maybe just kind of nibbling a little bit
and then $facebook is that last stock
that
i don't own yet but definitely thinking
about picking it up right now so
anyway that's kind of what's going
through my head right now i hope you
guys enjoyed the video let me know if
you agree or disagree with anything i
said
any socks that are on your radar make
sure you let me know down below i'm
always looking for more stocks to throw
into new videos
but uh thanks again for watching guys i
really appreciate all the support
i'll catch you in the next one hope
you're all doing well take care
