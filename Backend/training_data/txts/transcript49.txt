let's take a look at my portfolio okay
guys it never gets old
another green day and i'm happy to see a
little more green guys listen i'm up
over two and a half percent or the
equivalent of four thousand dollars
again i'm hoping you are up at some of
your place too
so we can get that good feeling back
okay listen i told you guys things will
begin
to turn around in a slow manner you got
one more week of this down stuff
before this becomes the normal for at
least another two or three months okay
so
again just enjoy these temporary green
days
as we still prepare for one more week of
doom and gloom then we should begin to
turn around things just a tad bit
remember though it doesn't turn around
overnight so don't think
your play is just going to shoot to the
moon in the month of april it will be a
slow climb so prepare for that
listen guys today i want to talk to you
and give an
update on some plays that's on fire as
well as look at some of our option plays
and how they're doing on the day
i'm going to kick things off with $charge
point guys ticker symbol $chpt
sending that 27 and 38 cents on the move
right now as we speak but listen guys on
the day it is up
22 i'm hoping all of you
that rock with me just trust the place
that we called in the huddle guys again
i told you i'm going to lead you
to a place that will allow you to retire
early lead a corporate plantation
and start living the life you deserve
guys it starts with doing it
by getting you all in great place at the
right price
matter of fact speaking of price let's
look at this we got 250 shares
with an average cost of 15.71 for me up
73
right now listen you all should have had
this play under 25
okay i told you between 25 and 19 we
wanted this so
i'm hoping you built out your positions
in the 1920s
and you're enjoying a little bit of this
run-up today towards 27
the high today has been 27.79
again it's a 50 play at the bare minimum
so again
buckle up and prepare for the ride
because we're going places guys
next up we have $crowdstrike tigger
symbol $crwd
is up over four and a half percent today
guys listen i want you on plays that are
movers aka runners okay there's one
thing to be in plays that are lagging
but it's another thing for me to put you
in quality plays that have the potential
to move a lot quicker
$charge point is one this is another
$crowd strike
okay today what we're looking like we
sitting at 60 shares with an average
cost of 180
okay so listen prepare for this to go
back to 200
it was just 169 yesterday okay and it
flew all the way up today to 183
that's how quick these things can move
once we get some good news in the market
all right
and the last play that i want to talk to
you guys about is $square
ticker symbol $sq sitting at 228
it is up 7 today the equivalent of a 15
this was just 200 yesterday guys and
today
it has taken off mightily i hope you
grab a few shares this i told you i
picked up 10 shares of this around 205
so i'm up 11 already in this particular
play
listen to get to 100k you have to be in
some runners you have to be in some
quality
plays that will get you there okay you
have to be in and out of penny stocks
but you got to be in the long haul
for these players it's going to take you
there all right really quickly let's
look at our option play
for $neo right now let's check out $neo
it's currently down 55 percent for me
at this point in time okay there were
spots again very small spots throughout
the day
that it was up however the thing you
need to do right now
is start thinking about what you think
$neo will do
tomorrow okay you got one more day this
is the thing i love about options
you got one more day to see if he begins
to turn around i want you to study
the trends that you saw today okay it
struggled to get to 38
to 39 okay can it hold or will it come
back down
will people take profits heading into
the weekend that's something i want you
thinking about
in terms of when you are going to sell
tomorrow okay
maybe it come back down to 37.5 our
strike price
consider getting out right there if it
blows through that tomorrow
okay next is $city ticker symbol $c
let's check out this option place we got
a 76 dollar call on this one now this
one
is up a little bit over almost six and a
half percent on the day
again we are in this one until the
4 to 16 okay so you got a little bit of
time to be in this one but this one is
already showing a little strength
again i didn't see this come down at one
time today
keep your eye on it okay watch what i do
tomorrow then watch what it do when you
get back into the market on monday okay
again just putting you in position to
win but hopefully i'm teaching you the
game
and hopefully you're having a little fun
along the way guys you're going to be
sharks you got to just stay the course
listen guys up next we have our question
of the day and our question of the day
is strength the beautiful thing about
today man
is i saw some small pockets of our plays
showing a little sign of strength
which is good to see okay again i'm very
confident in the place that i have
us in on this 100k challenge however
it again it feels good when we start to
see them wake up a little bit okay
the things you saw today like $charge
point
okay they showed a little bit of
strength they showed the ability to
still take off okay
and so that's a great sign because i
told you
by april 15th things should start moving
like this on a lot more consistent basis
not fast but at least more consistent
please mark my words on that so that you
don't think everything is going to just
shoot to the moon
as soon as april 15th come it's going to
be a slow and steady climb back
but we will see that okay but strength
is what i want you to pay attention to
look for your plays that are showing
signs of it okay
look at what's still acting weak look
what's still asleep
look what's still lagging behind and
then make sure you point out
the plays that are demonstrating signs
of strength listen guys up next we have
our question of the day and our question
of the day comes from
p y t v y purse 69
didn't realize the first 10 minutes of
the day was when i needed to sell my
option play on $neo
listen family this is a great point guys
that's one thing i want you to know i
don't care when the expiration date
is on any of your place sometimes you
can
sell out of your place within the first
five to ten minutes and they'll be up
okay
i'm not saying you guys miss $neo but
that is a great point it was
up very very quickly in the day okay it
did everything i told you it would do
when it start trending down okay however
i want those you that didn't sell if you
got it still hold it for tomorrow
to see what it do okay let it come back
down to 37 and beyond
all right but listen listen listen
listen
you don't have to hold your plays to the
expiration date okay
that is a cardinal sin that i see a lot
of you make
that is a rookie mistake that i see a
lot of times with new and beginning
investors thinking
oh we got $citigroup to 416. i gotta hold
it to 416.
no you can sell it monday if it pops you
can sell it today
if you like the games you had today okay
the expiration date is just
a buffer so that you give it time to do
what it's going to do
okay with $neo we don't have that much
time we got one more day
okay that's the fun part that i like
about this is it's either going to
go the way we want it to or it's not
regardless we let us see another day and
we'll be back right back at it
on monday morning okay but regardless of
that guys
understand your place can take off in
the first two to five minutes the first
five to ten minutes
be ready to take your profits when that
happens listen guys i hope that was
