hey there ladies and gentlemen let's
talk about $amazon and why i'm such a
huge fan of this company
now this is an exclusive video just for
channel members
and patrons and in this video i'm going
to talk for five minutes
why i'm such a huge fan of this company
i'm going to show you the numbers the
dcf
and everything so as you can see right
now the share price is
3 100 and you can see the overall trend
actually isn't that amazing i'll show
you in a second
if you go one month back you'll see
what's going on now
um i just want to show you something
really cool so if you take a look at
this a momentum chart right here you see
that this stock
literally lost share price in the past
six months
almost four percent now you don't have
to be a brain surgeon to know that
$amazon is pretty much the future of
of commerce and retail i mean brick and
mortar is going to go
completely out of business in the next
couple years everything is going digital
everything's going online
and their streaming business is going um
it's going to be one of the most
dominant forces in the
in the market they're about to sign a
massive deal with the nfl
and for the sunday ticket streaming
service it's going to be massive
and 2022 i believe that's going to
happen i don't think it's certain yet
but i think they're the front runners on
that
so this is ridiculous i mean how the
share loss price share
i don't understand but i mean it's
obviously an opportunity
if you take a look at it here and i'll
show you something really cool so
this is kind of the general chart and
what you can see here the short interest
i mean smart money isn't shorting this
stock one percent short interest
i mean there's very little
institutionals i'm sure the one percent
that actually did it were high or drunk
nobody shorting the stock for good
reason and let me show you some numbers
by the way this is
a brand thiel from jeffrey's we've used
them before is ranked number 49
out of 7 363 6 analysts on the pranks
so he's a stud and he's been right on
$amazon
pretty much every single time as you can
see here he had
19 out of 27 ratings actually profitable
70 percent
and his up 27.6 on the stock
since april 19 and so i mean the dude is
a stud
his target price is four thousand
dollars mine is higher i'm going to let
you know in a second how much exactly
but he sees a 30 upside i see much more
um
so let's get started so first of all the
momentum isn't good it's a dip
i think it's an opportunity so let me
show you some numbers here
so revenue growth year over year it's a
it's a 1.5 trillion dollar company
37.6 percent revenue growth
insane ebitda growth year over year that
means they're getting more efficient
33 this isn't some kakamemi startup i
mean this is kind of impressive
and look at these numbers right here
this is kind of impressive hold on a
second
um so this is the margins right
so 40 gross profit margin which is okay
for a physical products company
because they have a lot of physical
assets but even the margin
only 12.5 which means they can get a lot
better here
and this thing can get better and the
performance in the share price will be
quite noticeable
so they're not as efficient as far as
the bottom line i don't think they're
really trying yet at this point
um but look at the actual cash position
so these guys have 42 billion in cash
um and total assets are
i believe it's something in the vicinity
yeah 320 billion in total assets
and out of which um just 15 billion is
goodwill about five percent and 95
is actually legit assets if you scroll
down to the total liabilities right here
it's 227. so a lot of liabilities
but still there have definitely much
more assets and liabilities
they do have i highlighted here quite a
significant 32 billion dollar loan
but i mean with so much cash at hand i
mean they pretty much
can pay it off tomorrow they have 42
billion in cash so if they wanted to
they could close the loan tomorrow just
in cash not too concerned
however what i do want to show you is
the actual income statement because
here you'll see something really
interesting and look at the revenue
growth if you think that this is a
covert play
you're mistaking look at what's a bit
let's just look at the last five or six
years let's just ignore before that
100 billion 135 billion that's revenues
right 177 2032
280 386. now this is the master jump
right this is
this is definitely coveted busted for
sure but even before that they were
growing
quite well 172 sorry 177 to 232
to 280 without confidence so the company
is going to probably not grow as fast
but they're going to be going at it
right about i think 30 per year for the
next five years
and it's quite obvious to me so um
what it did want to show you something
else hold on a second where's the chart
i was looking for
oh yeah so i wanted to show you my dcf
um that i did for this company so
basically that's my dcf
um i assumed as you can see right here
that they're gonna get 251
billion dollars in capex investment so
my dcf assumes that these guys will be
spending
250 billion in capital
expenditures over the past over the next
five years
so it's a massive assumption because i
think they're going to be expanding
quite significantly
so yeah i know it's high but i want to
be conservative
and as you can see right here um this
is the growth rate perpetually i used
four percent
and the reason i used 19 and a half
percent multiple sorry i didn't have
multiple
is because it's e-commerce i don't think
it's a tech play a pure tech play
so e-commerce is about 19 and a half
it's not the regular 25.
you see i'm just trying to be
conservative i could have easily hyped
it up even more
i only use the 10 discount rate i
haven't gone lower as always you know
i try to keep it you know very very
conservative and
right here this is what you're looking
for right so this is my target price
5.3 000 so based on the scar price i see
this
not as a thirty percent undervalued
company as a seventy one point seven
three percent undervalued company this
is my target price
i actually bought quite a few shares
yesterday and
just a taste i think a thousand dollars
or two thousand dollars worth
just a little taste and i don't think
that's even one share um but i
after i post this probably today i'm
going to be loading up on quite an
amount
quite a good amount of more shares and
i'm really high on this company
i think they can they're the future of
e-commerce there's no no doubt about it
this current valuation is just a result
of the you know the tech sell-off
so yeah i hope you enjoyed this video
