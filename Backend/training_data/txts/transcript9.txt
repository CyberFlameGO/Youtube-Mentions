it's a good way to help me and to help
yourself take that investing that next
level now let's get into
the best ev stocks to buy 2021 version
now these are big plays
and i got some out there of course a lot
of us know what to expect in the ev but
these numbers are coming out $neo is
crushing it
$tesla's crushing it a lot of these
companies are coming out
in crushing numbers but at the end of
the day i want to take a look at where
they were
where they are how high have they come
because
if you're a new investor right now you
hear a lot of people talking about the
ev industry and where it's going
and when i always tell people in the
classroom i'd say look
if you're going to invest in something
invest in something that is going to
blow
up over the next five to 10 years look
long term
don't try to buy and double your money
every day
and every five days every month you know
that comes to be next to impossible but
if you can find an industry that's
growing
you can get in on the ground floor think
about when they always say if you had a
thousand or ten thousand dollars on
$amazon when it first came out you'd be a
millionaire ten years later
well that's my goal get rich slow with
mo that's my my steady
my study direction i'm trying to do that
for myself and anybody else out there
who is following along we've been buying
these evs since last summer
and they have paid off nicely now of
course we've had a correction
and that's why i'm here today talking
about the best ev stocks to buy now
because it's changed a little bit we
want to take a look to see which ones
give us the highest opportunity for
doubling our money
and of course i'd say a year or two and
i'm hoping this is going to be less than
that
if we get another big push up so let's
go and take a look at what we got so as
i get into these best ev stocks to buy
now i'm going to give you a couple
options i'm going to because i know
there's different investors out there
there's those who want the highest risk
and then there's those who want the
least amount of risk to me $tesla gives
you that opportunity
for the least amount of risk out of some
of these stocks now as a risk reward
goes
the higher the risk the higher the
reward now with $tesla
this is a new industry this is the
leading company in this industry
this is going to be the biggest of the
big is $tesla
i always tell people look at some of
these companies out there the $apples the
$amazons
you know they can get up there two three
trillion where do you see them down the
road could they be even five
ten trillion in market cap and i could
say yes now
we look at $tesla it's only 635 billion
and i don't see them as a car
dealer this company is going to be
energy energy storage
so much more you got insurance you got
all kinds of different arms for that
revenue
and i can just see it becoming bigger
and bigger and bigger
and i have a feeling that if you go with
this stock
this is going to be your more secure not
as volatile as the other ones we watched
that through the last ev
correction through february into march
that you notice that of all the stocks
in the evs a lot of them are getting
crushed
but if you actually take a look at $tesla
they didn't do as bad as everyone else i
know $neo is down i think over 50 percent
at one point
not $tesla $tesla was not i think it was
like 880
and it got down to about 560.
that's not 50 probably about 30 to 40
but still
that's my point even during the worst of
the worst it did not do as bad as
everyone else
and now they came out and i think you're
going to be pleasantly surprised
how well they do once we're through this
ev correction
and they come back up they're at a very
attractive number
and i'm going to show you what the
analysts think here at the end of all
these stocks
and i think uh then they'll give you an
idea which ones have the highest upside
potential
the next of the top ev stocks to buy now
is $neo now
i wanted to have some in us-based
companies china-based companies
they're the two biggest markets in my
opinion of course you're blowing up
right now but the
uh you got $neo moving into europe
$tesla's already there
so we have a lot of opportunities with
trying to diversify our ev holdings so
when it comes to the best ev stock to
buy
$neo for me in china with their backing
is a
easy number one but that remember i'm
here to talk about the different risk
now for the chinese-based stocks i do
think that
$neo is the least risky out of $x-pung
and $lee and of course $neo so $neo is
worth about 62 billion right now
a lot of people ask me do you think $neo
could ever be worth what $tesla is
and with $tesla being about 10 times
worth more
than $neo i absolutely do think that can
happen but i don't think they're going
to
catch $tesla i think they're going to
catch $tesla today in other words
what $tesla's worth now 600 something
billion i think $neo could get up there
as this market explodes over the next
five to ten years in other words do i
think that you can go 10 times on $neo
i do personally think so but i think it
might take 10 years i
i think that's a a good estimate of how
long it goes
and $neo would have to continue to have
to support
the tax support all kinds of good
support from the governments around the
world because for that to happen they
would have to go
global they'd have to be selling cars in
europe and having a really good
footprint there
but i think the key would they they'd
have to be in the u.s
if they come over to the u.s and europe
and china
i think then you could see $neo hit up
the 500
to 1 trillion dollar capital uh market
cap
but that has to happen if it doesn't
happen i still think $neo could get up to
200 to 300 billion in china alone with
that market cap
especially now they're doing a dual
listing which will have more demand on
their stocks
it's just better stuff so we're going to
find out what's going on now of course
you do have the
the i know people are talking about the
listings and other things like that we
got to keep our eyes on that
but i am hopeful that $neo will not have
to go through that but we'll see
and that is always the risk you take
okay
and so as we look at this year though i
did want to show this
if you got into this a year ago back
last april
you are now up 1300
so the question becomes is this done
going down and
i am hopeful that it is and we will see
where we go i thought a good base for
this stock would be 38.
uh i didn't think it would drop down but
we are right there and we have to wait
and see how this goes but i think we are
through april is going to be the last
month of tough times
and then i think we enter a nice little
sustained bull run
and we will see and i'm not going to be
surprised i think april in history i
think april is the second best month
of the 12 months for the stock market in
general and that's based on history but
let's hope it's
this month's no different and here's one
i'm just throwing in there this is my
own little take on this because i do
feel like we have a nice solid base here
and this is $churchill capital of course
this is $lucid
and i do think as soon as they can
finally start delivering vehicles and be
it
third quarter fourth quarter i do think
that this company will come alive in
stock price
moving forward they have a great quality
product we have we know it's going over
500 miles on a charge we know they can
get a thousand horsepower
it's it's a wower okay so i do think
you're going to see some big time
movement here
and we'll find out what's going on this
stock has uh
some potential to grow we know at one
point this was all the way up there
close to 60
and it came back down i do think this is
a good base for this
i'm not going to be surprised to see
this popping down the road
and so i am watching this one as we move
forward
now $lee otto another chinese ev company
and they you can see this is only worth
22 billion
and compared to $neo being up there
closer to 60 billions
so this is one third the size and it
does have some potential you can see
this came down dramatically as well if
we look at this at one point
it was down about 51 percent so all
these big chinese evs have dropped
around 50
or more and but now you're seeing that
little base and you're seeing it come up
now
they have a new low but it's a higher
low and that's a good sign that we are
going in the right direction from here
on out
and i'm feeling pretty good about this
so i i do think that $lee's going to do
well
and i'm going to show you some some
analyst numbers here shortly
the next of the best ev stocks to buy in
2021
of course we can take a look at this one
this is $x-fung and we come all the way
down the stock was down 62.70
this is one of the ones i thought would
have a lot of upside potential
and you can see that the the line has
changed and you can see how this was
drafting down
and now all of a sudden we're starting
to draft up i think that has come and
gone the correction
in my opinion the ev correction has run
its course and we are now going the
right direction
that is my opinion i've been buying
throughout this it's tough to do that to
keep pulling the trigger when it keeps
dropping
and look at this at a high of all the
way out there in november
we're all the way out in the march so
we're talking
december january february march i've
said this before
that once you look at a correction
and the corrections usually last on
average four to five months
if we actually go from the top of this
and go all the way out
this correction would be four months
long and the average correction
is over four months long so this is
actually a very big
crash because it's more than 20 but at
this point
um they always say if you can go up and
you're up over 10
since the low uh or you're starting the
next run and look at this
we are up to 37 so i do think we're
starting our next bull run with this
stock
and we will see how it goes and last and
you know i don't talk about this one a
lot but i own this and i like it it's
$fisker
i think $bisker has a huge upside
potential and you're going to be
surprised by this company not a lot of
people talking about it i actually think
it
i put it in there because it's one of my
top six stocks that i think are going to
do well
and if i had to guess i think $fisker it
might outperform
many of these stocks in the short term
and possibly long term
we'll wait and see but look had you know
it didn't have the same crash as
everything else in terms of
of being all the way out here and just
going no no no it had a big push-up then
i had a sell-off
and that was from news from some
analysts out there giving us some very
high
lofty uh potential
stock prices and i think everybody
bought in and you saw that stock
climb climb climb but now it's back to
that nice solid 15
16 dollar base and we're at 1690.
i did think if you look at this 15 to 16
dollars is a good base
and so the downside potential on this
one to me personally i think is limited
about 10 percent i think the upside
could easily get back up there uh higher
into the 25 to 30
range over the next 12 months and we
will see with that being said let's take
a look at the tip ranks i like this if
you haven't checked it out
i have a link down in my description
right now highly recommend this program
they put all the work in there
all the research of all these analysts
they put it all in one place
and they have tons of other great things
for you to check out now let's go ahead
and take a look at
$tesla first and you will see there's a
12.61
upside potential with 18 best performing
analysts now i like to go
and take a look at the last four and you
can see 950 900
800 880 this pushes it up there close to
that 900
range i actually think it can get up
there closer to 9.50
we'll see i i after uh hearing a lot of
the numbers being released this
last week i thought man they are set to
go
crazy out there and i think you're going
to see that of course we have the chip
and the chip issues that i'm hearing
about and that's something once we get
through and that's temporary it doesn't
take away from the fact that people want
to buy a $tesla
it just means you might have to wait a
little bit and the next one we have is
$neo so now
we go from $tesla being 12 upside
potential
to 63 for $neo remember this isn't which
company
is going to do the best i mean if you
look at that
the market cap of $tesla tells us it's
already crushing everyone else it's
worth 600 and something
billion it can actually take 10 percent
of that and go and buy
the entire $neo company and so keep this
in mind
that's how big $tesla is $tesla is a huge
mostly and when i say when i look at the
eevee industry
it's the safer bet in my opinion when
you
when you want to invest in a company you
want something that is leading in the
industry that's the way i do it
their numbers look fantastic they're
continuing to grow
and they are dominating around the world
that's $tesla now $neo
it's the smaller more risky but the
upside potential
as you can see from the analysts and as
for me i think it has a chance to double
quicker
because if they can pull things out do
things right you're going to see a
higher
push quickly because it's a much smaller
company the market cap's only about 60
billion
but it's higher risk in other words if
they miss if they mess up a little bit
the stock can crash
quickly and so that's always a danger
and with $tesla
you got biden with all the tax credits
and everything else for the american ev
companies that could be rolling out here
in the next few months
that are going to give it a big time
boost and so
you got to look at all that all those
external factors are going to affect
these companies i like $neo and china
i like $tesla in the united states as
well as both of them
should be going international in terms
of you know we already know $tesla is but
i'm talking about $neo growing outside of
the borders they're already getting over
into europe and they're
looking for job offerings here in the
united states i'm having people sending
me
some of the job announcements they're
making over here so
does that mean in five to ten years they
could be here absolutely and if that
happens what do you think is going to
happen
that stock should take off just based on
that news alone
all right the next one $lee this is
always to me a little smaller but look
51 percent upside potential you can see
some of these 38.25 it's only at 25.
i think it has that potential as well i
likely i have it in my portfolio i have
all these in my portfolio
but i do like $neo a little better but
$lee has that good upside potential if
you want to diversify
the next of the best ev stocks to buy
now is
$x-pung if we take a look at $x-punk this
has look at this 23.68
upside potential you got some
reiteration here 53-10
so some of these have it actually a lot
higher than this up closer to 40
range i think it could get up to 40 to
50 up by the end of this year
if everything goes right we can get
through the chip thing and the
the cove is under control you should see
these stocks take off if they don't and
we have to wait an extra couple months
into 2022 i think it still happened then
and so this is one of them ones if
you're buying into it i don't buy into
it for a week or two
i'm buying into these for a couple of
years and that's what i'm looking at
eventually though
i'm always watching for that next
growing industry and that's why you want
to subscribe
because i'm always going to be rotating
my money to where i think i can make the
most on the gains
$fisker this is one look at the 71.6
upside potential this is your surprise
of the day this had the biggest upside
potential
and i think they could do it they're
going to benefit from biden as well i
think you're going to see some big time
upside potential here and this will move
and we will see what happens but the
latest one coming out had it is 17
from barclays and i disagree i think
it's going to go back up there 25 to 30
like i said
and we will see that is all i got for
you today this is my
video on the best ev stocks to buy now i
own all of these but my biggest
is $cciv with $lucid i'm really rolling
the dice there i want this i think in
5-10 years
that'll be multiples of where it is now
and of course $tesla
and $neo i got a ton of them but i also
added on to
$fisker as well so and i have my $expunge
and $lee as well so i have them all but
these are the best ev stocks to buy now
so that's what i got for you today if
you haven't done it take advantage of
the two free stocks from weeble down
