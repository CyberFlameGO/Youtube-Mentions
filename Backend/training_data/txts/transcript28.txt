what is going on guys welcome back to
another video in this video we are going
to break down the upcoming trading week
i'm going to break down the major
economic events to look out for
um some news some earnings and what
stocks i am watching and my update on
the overall
market with that being said let's get
started
so first and foremost what are some
things that are going on with the
overall market
uh we have a short week ahead meaning
market is closed on friday
uh continuously keep watching for the
end of the quarter of rebalancing that
has been happening last week and we are
going to
see it happen this week as well or i
expect it to happen this week as well
uh we have major economic events coming
out we have the jobs report on friday we
have the ism reporting
and pmi and this is the whole uh the
full
economic calendar as you guys can see we
have tons of economic data coming out
that the market is heavily focused on
uh the market will also be very focused
on joe biden's infrastructure plan
uh which he's expected to talk about on
wednesday or on
uh unveil on wednesday so i would
definitely pay attention or keep that
date in mind because these are market
moving events
right now there's other things as well
i'm gonna dive into everything but just
a few more things that i want to talk
about chinese stocks
a lot of chinese stocks are you know
there's a lot of fear around them
because the sec is
adapting measures that would possibly
kick foreign companies off
american stock exchanges so a lot of
chinese names are also on watch
right now going on to the economic event
calendar once again we got a lot of
stuff going on
right jobs report coming out on friday
uh friday market is closed but the
market will be seeing what happens on
this day we have the ism and we have the
pmi reporting on thursday
we also have the consumer confidence
report are being reported on tuesday
and like i said on wednesday joe biden
will be revealing uh the infrastructure
plan
so these are things once again to pay
attention to from an economic standpoint
of view
now diving into the market and seeing
where the market is right let's just
start off with $spy
so as you guys can see uh $spy is
approaching all-time highs we're at the
398 400 level almost
uh friday we did see a very very strong
close if you guys see the close on
friday
you can see right on the end of the end
of the day on friday we saw a
huge acceleration in price followed by
volume to a new
level or a high of the day at 396 for
$spy
right we are looking for a continuation
going on into this week i do think we
are going to see the continuation
especially if this rebalancing happens
the right way
and we do we constantly see some flow
into the market
now looking at the tech sector as you
guys can see tech sector is still
taking a hit right so if you look at the
overall market guys the overall market
in my opinion is holding up pretty
strong
right but when we go on to the tech
sector the tech sector is detected
that's really really taking a hit right
now
and hasn't fully recovered so if you
take $nq right now
from the high of thirteen thousand nine
hundred and you
kind of look at where we are right right
now
right we're down about seven eight
percent we went into a correction zone
so we're down about eight percent out of
that correction zone but we're still
technically very very down from that
high point right seeing us being down
from that high point is still
creating a lot of pressure on a lot of
the tech names
going into $spy once again $spy is holding
very
very well and like i said we are seeing
cleaner movements
however one thing i do want to talk
about market has been
very tough to trade a lot of people have
been dming me talking to him about it
and i understand the market has not been
easy to trade the past few weeks
and hopefully going into q2 in april we
might see some more movement and
historically april is
a much easier month to trade now right
now i
do not have any current swing positions
open
i'm cash in all my swings i am looking
at some swings but i think my swing
positions i'm possibly going to look
into
next week i think just going to let this
week settle down and get some more
direction going on to earnings these are
all the companies that have earnings
my two watches for earnings are number
one $chewy report after
after close on tuesday and micro $micron
$mu
after close on wednesday these two names
are really really being watched
$chewy is still trading sideways as you
guys can see
uh we're still in like a sideways chop
area right here around 75 hold but i
want to see how they report earnings do
we get a gap up play above 90 or do we
get a gap down
a play below uh 75 and then $mu is
another name
that has been holding pretty strong has
been holding pretty
well this is another earnings plan on
watch besides the earnings plays on
watch
what are some main names that i am
looking to trade this week
so let's break that down uh first name
$tesla now obviously $tesla has been
taking major major hits
uh as $tesla's been taking major major
hits what's my outlook on $tesla
now i've said this before whenever i'm
breaking stocks down i never
kind of predict what's going to happen
right
and i don't think you guys should try to
predict either what i mean by that is
i'm not going to sit here and say oh i
think $tesla's going to go up or i think
$tesla's going to go down
no i that's not i don't think that's the
way to trade i think the proper way to
trade
is understanding levels of supply
understanding levels of demand
understand understanding market
sentiment and market direction
market sentiment right now for a lot of
these names that are overvalued are
still
bearish so $tesla still technically looks
very bearish
now that does not mean $tesla's going to
go down that does not mean $tesla's going
to go up that's not the point i'm trying
to make
the point i'm trying to make is once you
identify that direction a little bit
you put that direction with price action
to get a little bit more action going
so in simple terms looking at $tesla my
play with $tesla right now is let's say
going into monday let's say going into
tuesday
we do see some weakness in the market if
we see some weakness in the market
primarily the tech sector
uh seeing $tesla get around that 600
level again and seeing
how we react around the 600 level could
be a huge point now you have to
understand $tesla some days does move 40
to 50 points
so seeing a 20 point move down could
still leave us for another 20 or 25
move uh more down or another 25 move up
or down whatever the case may be
so the point is if we do see a weak
market $tesla is
could be a play that we could
continuously look to play on the
downside right now on the upside i'm not
looking for anything yet i would really
need to see the
market has bottomed out the tech sector
is looking to hold
that's when i would look to take on a
trade on the upside for $tesla any trade
on tests on the upside
would kick in on levels such as 650
would be my level number one that i
would really pay
attention on with $tesla i think unless
we see 650s it'd be very hard for me to
really kind of gauge any sort of uh
traction towards $tesla towards the
upside and remember
market has been very hard guys so we may
not see any good plays or any
good continuation plays so if you do
take a trade remember it's a scalpers
market in and out a few seconds a few
minutes get in get out
right another thing with $tesla $neo tess
and neil or
$neo are both looking to report delivery
numbers
for end of q1 so we might see that on
april 1st on thursday or possibly over
the weekend or next week but
keep that in mind for thursday maybe you
wake up you see some news a catalyst
play
but this is one reason i'm watching them
next we got $mu we got chewie
both of these names have earnings coming
up so they're both on watch for earnings
right
now going on to my last three plays uh
these are plays that i'm really really
interested in number one target
uh i think we're seeing a lot of
strength in target friday we got a nice
gap up play above 194.
that 194 on target was very very strong
you guys can see and we saw a nice
continuation on
uh target to all-time highs around two
one two or twos
i think we're coming right there again i
think if we do see some strength going
into monday or tuesday
we could see another accelerated push
but 200 is the main area to watch for
target
retail is getting more money uh getting
uh there's more money in flowing into
retail right now
because of the possible reopening and
that is driving names
like target and so on higher right so
target could be a play let's just say we
don't see something tomorrow
we could possibly see something happen
tuesday wednesday or next week but i
want to see how we react around the 200
and like i said
we're in a scalpel's market guys we get
some we get some movement going in
for all the people that trade options
you guys know one point could really
really piss well
right uh besides target another name i
am watching
is $home depot look at $home depot guys
and this is this is the point i was
trying to make right for all the people
that were saying oh well you know
market's going down
yeah market isn't going down the tech
sector has been taking a hit look $home
depot bottom to 250. it's about
up about 54 points from that bottom
right we've been going on a
crazy run recently as more money is
being flown out of tech and going into
other names or other sectors $home depot
has been
you know one of the one of those names
where we're seeing a ton of inflow
uh same thing with target right so these
are two names that i would be very very
interested in
seeing how they move if we do see some
continuation like i said there's more
and more money kicking in
another name i like $airbnb uh i think
$airbnb is not really responding the way
i expected it to win once again the way
i expect the way you expect doesn't
really matter and the market doesn't
care
uh but i think with more reopenings to
happen i kind of expect this name to
pick back up
uh so this name's on watch because i
think once that
rotation continues and once we do see
some inflows kick in i think $airbnb
could be one of those names where we
could start seeing a heavy heavy heavy
rally
now some other names i'm watching
primarily not for tomorrow
but just for the upcoming week uh
$walmart right
i think $walmart is very oversold we're
extremely oversold around the 135s
um i think if we are able to regain the
150s once again
i think we got a good shot at you know
things moving in our direction we're in
oversold territory so seeing a 10-point
move up
kind of makes sense right uh but there's
a lot of you know noise going on with
$walmart too if you haven't been watching
them
but i think seeing $walmart overall get
back into that 140
uh could be a strong play same thing
looking at $disney
right you're seeing a lot of these names
hold up well same thing going into $ba
uh holding up pretty well all these
plays are setting up but the last point
i want to make before i end this
is guys trading has been very very hard
the past few weeks i don't know for you
guys for me it has been and i know for
so many other
people you need to adjust to the market
you need to adjust to what the market is
doing you need to adjust to your trading
style
january has been a much easy month going
on to a little bit of february and then
from there things went downhill
not saying downhill like or you're
losing money but downhill as in
what worked in january isn't working now
so you need to adapt and shift and when
you adapt and shift sometimes you need
to play with smaller size
so with that being said my approach for
this week is to still play defense so i
can
end this quarter the right way and not
give back profits if i do see an
opportunity i will take advantage but
i'm very curious to see how the
rebalancing happens i don't want to be
caught off
balance with any sort of money rotation
or market rotation
so i'm waiting for that to close out and
i think once that close closes out
starting off next week is my goal
uh to you know start off fresh and take
things from there but if there is an
opportunity i'll take it there but once
again
i'm possibly still looking for a a slow
week maybe if not we'll see how things
go that's why this video is
isn't super in depth because there's not
not many names i want to really talk
about because i don't know if the floor
has been
found yet so i don't want to dive into
them and quote unquote make predictions
and make price levels
until i i see a full rebalance and i get
more direction from the market
with that being said i'm sorry about
making this video you know at a very
late time
i just got the time to make it so i was
like let me hop on here and make it
upload it and you know for all the
people that
are in like new york or on the eastern
time zone i'm sorry you know it's like
12 a.m for you guys
but i'm gonna put this up right now and
i hope you guys enjoyed it and comment
down below what you guys are watching
for tomorrow
and um i'll see you guys in the next
video thank you so much
