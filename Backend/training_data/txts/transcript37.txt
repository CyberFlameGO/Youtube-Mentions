$neo stock has been on an absolute terror
last year and they were one of the
fastest growing large cap stocks of 2020
and i think we can see more growth this
year in 2021 the $neo and $tesla battle
will only get bigger and that's what i'm
gonna talk about today
many government officials have done some
questionable things like buying $tesla
calls
and this is all very interesting we
don't see something like this too often
and know that 95 of all options expire
worthless
so their confidence means something much
deeper in this video
i'm going to be covering the battle
between $neo and $tesla and why $tesla is
going to have a bright future for 2021
as well as some downsides to this too i
will also go over
$neo and where i can see them going make
sure you subscribe and hit the bell
you guys know i always keep a 100 with
you and let's get right into it
so first of all $tesla has huge
government-backed subsidies for evs
under the new biden administration and
backing from congress as well
biden winning the election was a huge
win for all eb companies
as his administration has said from day
one of the campaign
that they will prioritize making clean
energy vehicles cheaper
whether that is electrically powered
vehicles or even biofuel powered
vehicles
speaking of biofuels i talked about $gevo
and since my last video on them
they have doubled anyway this can also
be a bad thing for $tesla in some way
because joe biden's economic advisor
brian diese said i quote
we need more companies from all over the
world to be selling ev
so that $tesla is not the only eevee
giant and there's more of a variety of
ev
and one ev company doesn't become a near
monopoly we also know that brian diese's
company
blackrock owns over 53 million shares of
$meal
so this affects both sides including
$tesla now $tesla i believe
will still grow by two to three times in
the next decade but a lot of growth has
already happened
and if $tesla goes through with their
energy plans i can see them being a two
trillion dollar company by 2024.
anyone who's been following $tesla since
day one knows that their business model
has been proved sustainable
through primarily subsidies $tesla to
date has lended billions of dollars in
subsidies from over 80 federal grants
and with the recent announcements from
joe biden that they will be announcing
clean energy subsidies in the billions
and possibly extending even to trillions
of dollars it's no wonder that ev stocks
have been pumping for the past month
some of this has not even been priced in
yet and this is why i've been holding a
hundred shares for almost three years
now on the contrary also keep in mind
michael bury
is shorting $tesla which is a big reason
as to why i'm just holding a hundred
shares
to just sell covered calls on this
michael bury has not been wrong much
and he is very confident with his plays
just this week he made over 250 million
dollars from gamestop
so he is a very well respected investor
and his rating means a lot for all
companies
both with the large market cap and small
i want to give an alternate perspective
and michael bury is a very bold investor
so i value his opinion highly
and his reasoning now regardless of
whether you believe $tesla to be
overvalued or not
its market cap has increased so much
that the company has been able to
leverage its highly increased value
to get huge loans with extremely cheap
interest rates
this allows elon to continue funding
future ventures such as nero link which
allows him to expand the company
into newer and newer territories to keep
the stock going up
it's important to understand this
phenomenon since it helps explain why a
lot of companies are pumped up
but never really come down because they
were able to utilize their position
as a blue chip company effectively now
it may come as no
surprise to you that congress people as
a group are the people with the highest
returns in comparison to the markets
they have the insider information and
they really know the intentions of other
congressmen
and political figures more than anyone
else on the planet
in this chart you can see that while the
average american was underperforming the
market
u.s senators were able to do even better
than the corporate insiders while
members of the house of representatives
were on par with them
i always want you guys to be on the best
and most exclusive information
possible which is why i always say keep
a 100 and here's the latest information
for $tesla
nancy pelosi the speaker of the house
just invested over a million dollars
into just $tesla stock
remember that congress persons have to
make their investments public
and it's always important to keep track
of them given their high success
if you want the latest updates on this
hit the bell and subscribe to my channel
because my main focus extends into
analyzing how government officials
are going to be influencing a variety of
stocks and even penny stocks
every sector has a bias no matter what
by these government officials
and it's important to be kept up to date
with this now notice how nancy pelosi
is doing this right before biden
announces his new evie deal
we recently had him announce an
all-electric eevee fleet so this sector
is looking great
i am taking full advantage of this for
the next four years and longer
and have been up by over a thousand
percent with $$sun works or ticker symbol
$sun w
i also have been up by over 500 with
$tesla
and could have been up even bigger if i
dollar averaged in a little earlier
and before $tesla stock really took off
to even above a hundred dollars
pre-split
anyway this allocation from the speaker
of the house is indicative of the fact
that there will be a heavy bias in
congress
to make sure that $tesla receives
government contracts and continues to
receive the massive subsidies it does
i'm not telling you that $tesla is going
to the moon tomorrow or in a week
but rather that congress people are
invested in it and have chosen them for
the year
it's always important to see if congress
people own a percentage of the shares in
a company
since that means it's more likely to
receive government support and is
something that is crucial for a company
getting subsidies and having a pullback
period
for these reasons $tesla is poised for a
very solid 2021 and i can see them going
to above a thousand dollars a share
this year even if they have a big
pullback now real quick
i have a very special announcement to
make for all of you guys
so first off my developers and business
partners i used to work with
have come up with a script that actually
can predict the trend of stocks
and can predict and analyze lots of data
ai statistics and advanced analytics are
the future
and one of the coders who used to work
at google has offered a script to me
and us and it's not as good as the
scripts that wall street uses but we are
updating it each day
to make it to that level i think it's
very important to see what the rich
people are doing
and what congress people are doing
because they have an edge over us
no matter what so what my team has done
is we have a web scraper for both
congressmen and it's able to see all of
the results on forums
including reddit quora stock twits
discord and even weeble
and they have granted a license for us
to work with them this is very
interesting and i have used it so far
only for bitcoin but this will be
included in our patreon at the start of
february
so be sure to check out my patreon below
if you want access to our exclusive web
scraper
my private portfolio as well as my penny
stock picks and it all comes to the
private discord
so check it out below people in places
of power will always have the advantage
over us
so we need to be able to track what they
do with data and it's important to see
what they do
so we can get to them and hire
now let's talk about $neo stock now if
you have been following the channel
and have been here since the beginning
you would know i have been invested in
$neo since they were valued at 12
a share and i am still holding strong i
own 4 400 shares of $neo stock
and think the stock has more growth to
be made as the market cap is still under
100 million dollars
i think we can still see lots of growth
by many multiples still
and it has huge potential they are
dominating in the largest eva market in
the world
which is china and they're just starting
to get into the second largest evening
market in the world which is europe
they proved all of the short sellers
wrong and even made citron report go
extinct
[Music]
now jokes aside we have had multiple
different price target increases
and i even said this about two months
ago in a video that all of these price
targets will be increased and are biased
because of the situation in china
i am still very bullish on $neo and don't
plan on selling anytime
soon i look at companies with a 20 30
vision and always look at a stock with a
long term lens

are even open check out the weeble link
