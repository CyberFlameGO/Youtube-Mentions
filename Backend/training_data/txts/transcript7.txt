how's it going everyone it's sam i
wanted to talk to you about a spec today
that just announced their merger with
$etoro
so this is similar to something like
$robin hood
but it's i believe it's a little bit
more international and i'll hit on that
in a second
but i had run a little analysis between
this
and between the $sofi spack i should be
saying
and i compared both of them side by side
looked at future projections
and i want to compare it for you guys i
had done that for the patreon and until
someone asked me on my video that i just
released
i didn't even really think about making
a video on it because i did this pretty
quickly but i think that it can provide
a lot of
a lot of good to a lot of people so if
you guys like this if you guys
like these kinds of analysis between two
different companies please leave a
thumbs up please let me know in the
comments below
there is a link down there to weeble in
case you want some free stocks i would
love to see weeble go public i want to
see what their evaluation and
compared to these companies uh let me
know and maybe in the comments if you
want to see that uh
but there is that link down there in
case you want to get some
free shares of stock and there is a link
down there to block five two in case you
want to check that out you can get up to
250
and uh you can also get an interest rate
on your cryptocurrency there's also a
link down there
to the patreon if you guys want to get
this information a little bit earlier
and you know i apologize i i'm a little
bit tired today
uh i think all this wedding planning
stuff buying a house taxes
uh the the dip towards the end of the
day oh man it just
it's making me a little bit tired i
actually have uh a kirkland
energy shot here not a sponsor or
anything but i'm gonna take some of that
as soon as we're done here
uh but we're gonna we're gonna get
through this here so they're merging
with
$ftcv so this
back was just announced today and it
went up 43
so a couple things that you should know
before we even look at the investor
presentation
it's being valued around 10 billion
dollars there's a pipe
included in here and the investors
include ion investment group
softbank vision fund 2 third point llc
fidelity and wellington management so
some pretty big names there
you can see here that they have
popularity in the european and asian
countries
so that's why i think we don't have as
much that we hear about it here in the
u.s
because really i hadn't heard about
$etoro too much i had heard the name but
i didn't really know too much
about how big they were and they're
actually putting up some pretty good
numbers so they're very similar to $sofi
where some companies just focus on stock
investing
this holds a a plethora of different
products that they have you can see the
registered users have grown dramatically
even since the end of last year so this
is the end of each
uh period and they had 17.5 million
users at the end of 2020 and
this obviously is not directly
correlated with the size of these graphs
i
i hate that it's something that they
teach in school when they're not
the same proportion so there's about a 5
million difference here between 2019 and
2020 and then about a 1 million
difference here
already though in january which is a
large amount
increase now they have 1.2 million
funded accounts definitely less than
their registered users
and about 69 of their funded accounts
are
in europe 18 in asia pacific region and
then
eight percent in the americas so they're
in some countries that we don't see a
lot of
exposure to with some of the investing
apps that we invest in here
now i will compare these two together $so
fi
and $etoro they launched in 2010
they were fun founded in 2007. they
introduced bitcoin back in 2013 so
a very early adopter they say converging
the $etoro experience into a single
device application in 2015 launched
smart portfolios and additional crypto
assets in 2017 and then launched zero
commission stocks and expand to the us
in 2019 now they hit on the fact that
this is a huge total addressable market
totally true especially as more and more
people
are joining the market and as more and
more millennials are looking for these
kinds of platforms
it's definitely something where there's
a lot of money to be made
now they have smart portfolios they have
$etoro money
they are expanding into the us i
wouldn't be surprised if they started
other lines of business or other
products in here
that could really help them expand and
by that i mean getting into
credit cards loans other types of income
that can be driven into the business
because right now most of their money is
just coming from trading revenue
there's also some interest income and
some currency conversion and other
income
but most of it's from trading revenue
then you can see their compounded annual
growth rate it's actually pretty high
but they did have a big dip in 2019
they are expecting uh about 605 million
dollars for 2020
with net revenue about 544 million
they are expecting to increase revenue
quite drastically over the coming years
now comparing these two companies
comparing $sofi
and then comparing $etoro all these
numbers are in millions except for the
price per share but $etoro
is in about 15 per share so far about
18.8
their approximate valuation at 10 a
share was about
10 billion dollars for $etoro and about
8.6 billion dollars
for $sofi that means the valuation right
now
is actually pretty similar between these
two companies it's about 16 billion for
$sofi and 15 billion for $etoro 2020
revenue
is pretty similar between these two
companies too so $sofa is about 621.
$etoro is about 605. now they are very
different and
that $etoro is more european-based and $so
phi
is much more u.s based you can see that
their 2020 price to sales ratio is
pretty similar
with $etoro at about 25 and so if i about
26
the 2022 revenue is where we start
diverging and i didn't look at 2021
2023 or 2024 i really just did it two
years out and then five years out which
you'll see in
here in a second but $so fi expects to be
to about 1.5 billion dollars worth of
revenue
while $etoro is about 1.2 billion i would
expect these to be somewhat
on point with what they'll actually hit
because these companies try to do a
pretty good job
sometimes they might come in actually a
little bit lower on their estimations
they try not to overestimate because
that's
really bad for the share price but that
is what they're saying now
that means that the 2022 price to sales
ratio of $sofi is about 10.77
as opposed to about 12.55 now 2025
we see a big difference here about 3.7
billion dollars
in revenue for $sofi and about 2.55
billion dollars
for $etoro giving them a pretty different
price to sales one is about 5.89
and then one's about 4.4 so we started
to see a little bit of divergence
now they're pretty similar honestly in
their valuation
in their revenues as more and more
companies come to the market
a lot of these companies will be pushed
back a little bit and not thought of as
much
but there is still some hype around
these companies as they're getting
closer to their spac merger
and these are really fintech companies
that should trade at pretty high
multiples i think
these definitely are expensive companies
based on where they are now but five
ten years down the line might not be as
expensive i still hold
shares of $sofi i have not bought $etoro
there's actually a company that i bought
that i told my patreon members about
this morning that is a brokerage
but not one of these and it's already
been on the market for a while
it's moving up very quickly it's growing
revenues very quickly quicker than both
of these companies by far
if you guys want to check that out i'll
probably do a video on it over the next
few days
but if you guys want to check it out a
little bit sooner uh there's definitely
a link down there to my patreon if you
guys want to check that out thank you
guys so much i appreciate it and i will
see you guys in the next video if you
want to see my video
on what to expect over the next day or
two in the market definitely check out
this video here on the end screen
thanks
you
