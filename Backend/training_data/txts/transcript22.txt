hello everyone and welcome back to
another video in today's video i just
want to talk about my four largest
holdings in my portfolio right now
and these are stocks that i am actively
going to be adding to on
any dips that we see in the market or in
these individual companies
in this video i just want to present to
you all my quick bull thesis on these
stocks as well as some recent due
diligence and research that i've been
doing on these individual companies
so let's just hop right into the video
and the first dock that i want to talk
about is $td bank and i haven't talked
about this stock on my channel
for quite some time however this is
still one of the largest
positions in my portfolio and this stock
is like a consistent
steady gainer that just has just been
gaining very very nicely
if we take a look at a one year chart we
can see again no matter what the overall
market has been doing
this stock has just been absolutely
producing consistent gains from my
portfolio
and what i absolutely love about $td bank
is their very nice dividend yield
so even after the stock has run so much
in the last year
the dividend yield is still around four
percent on today's share price
$td bank has also been benefiting greatly
from the sector rotations that we're
seeing in the market recently
i mean just a month ago the stock was
selling for about 74 or 75 dollars a
share
and today it's selling for 79 a share
and it looks like it could even go on to
break 80 dollars a share here quite soon
the reason $td bank is experiencing so
much benefits right now
despite the overall market selling off
is again because of the sector rotation
and people worrying
that interest rates are going to start
going up to match the 10-year bond
yields
now banks they make a large portion of
their revenue
from interest rates so if interest rates
are going to go up or people think that
interest rates are going to go up
then banks stand to benefit greatly this
is why
so much money has been flowing over into
the banking sector lately because
everyone is worried about interest rates
rising right now and banks stand to
benefit if interest rates do in fact
climb up
and $td bank i think personally is one of
the best bank stocks you can own in the
stock market
so let's just take a quick look at the
fundamentals of $td now so here we can
see in 2019 they produced 38.04 billion
dollars in revenue and in 2020 they
actually dipped down to 36.4 billion
now obviously banks got hit pretty hard
in 2020 because of
all of the defaults on loans and all the
kind of delayed payments and everything
going on with the whole you know global
situation
so i'm not surprised to see that $td did
experience a little bit of a dip in
revenue in 2020. however
check this out if we take a look at the
quarterly revenue that $td bank is now
producing
for the fourth quarter of 2019 they
produced 10.93
billion dollars in revenue and for the
first quarter of 2021
they produced 10.5 billion dollars in
revenue
and 3.28 billion dollars in earnings
so if we take this 10.5 billion dollars
in revenue and we put it on an
annualized basis
it means that $td bank is now making over
40 billion dollars in annual revenue and
about 12 to 13 billion
in earnings this simply means that $td
bank is projected to do a record year
for revenue in 2021
and this bank is not slowing down at all
like this bank doesn't care what is
going on in the world
it just keeps on growing and producing
so much revenue and cash flow
now another thing that i want to point
out is $td bank's strong
and consistent growth to their dividend
since 1995
their dividend has grown by a compounded
annual growth rate on average
of 11 this is a fantastic dividend
history
this is also why i love investing in
dividend companies because
my dividend yield on cost i believe was
like 5.54
but if $td continues increasing their
dividend year over year over a year for
like the next 30 years
then my dividend yield on cost for my
initial investment could grow to like 20
30 40 maybe even 50 percent on an
annualized basis
dividend stocks that continue growing
their dividends year after year after
year
are a great way to grow your portfolio
and continue getting a consistent cash
flow in your portfolio
if we take a look at the analyst price
targets for $td bank over the next year
we can see that on the high end they are
projecting the stock to go to about 91
dollars and 22 cents
and on the low end they are projecting
about 71.17
the average price targets for analysts
is about 81.81 over the next year which
is about
3.66 upside from where the stock
currently is today
so in general analysts are actually a
little bit bullish on $td bank over the
next year
and i would have to agree check out this
article that i found
this article right here says toronto
dominion bank or $td
shuts down 82 branches but the stock
soars
further down in this article it says the
main reason $td is shutting down u.s
branches is because it wants to move to
a more
online focused business model as more
and more banking services go digital the
need for physical branches
is reduced many banking services can
today be delivered entirely
online for example insurance and cash
transfers
in fact even check cashing in this
environment a lot of money can be saved
by eliminating branches
by doing so you get rid of overhead
costs rent machinery etc
while retaining all of the services you
offered before so doing so
is a no-brainer i absolutely love this
and i do bank with $td
and i have to admit i do pretty much all
of my banking over online means now like
just over the computer or on my phone or
something like that
so seeing $td bank close down their
branches and want to move to a more
online business model
i think is absolutely awesome and it
should only improve the company's
margins over time so in my opinion i
believe that $td bank is innovating
they're trying to move more online
they're trying to get more of their
users on the computer or on their mobile
app
and i think that this is only going to
benefit the company moving forward
i am incredibly impressed with this
business and i think that this
innovation that they're doing to move
more online
is only going to serve shareholders well
for years to come
i am going to continue holding this
stock and if it sees any meaningful dips
in 2021 or
in the coming years i think that this is
a stock to buy on any significant dips
and i'm going to be looking to add to
this position whenever i can
alright but now let's move on and talk
about the second stock and this is
$brookfield renewable partners
or $bep at one point $brookfield
renewables was the largest position in
my portfolio it's no longer the largest
position anymore because i've been
building truly
so aggressively on all of these dips but
$brookfield is still one of the largest
positions in my portfolio
$bep is one of the largest renewable
energy utility companies in the world
like
this company right here is an absolute
beast in the renewable sector
i still believe that the world is moving
toward renewables and the world
is actively trying to go green and i
ultimately think that the sell-off that
the whole
entire renewable energy sector is seeing
is providing a really good opportunity
for long-term investments
i mean if we take a look at a six-month
chart here we can see that $bep topped
out right near
50 a share and it's just been kind of
down trending
ever since really the end of january
however
i don't think that anything has happened
to the fundamentals of this business
and i think that this is still a really
fundamentally strong company
$bep also offers a really nice dividend
of just under three percent
at its current share price and i love
dividend stocks i think that having
large positions in dividend stocks is a
great way to continually build your
portfolio no matter what the stock is
doing
let's just take a little bit of a deeper
look into $brookfield as a business now
so right here on this slide we can see
that $brookfield renewables is in fact
a global clean energy utility provider
in north america they have 33 billion
dollars of renewable assets
south america 13 billion dollars worth
in asia two billion
and in europe they have nine billion
dollars worth of renewable assets
in total they have 57 billion dollars
worth of renewable assets
and 19 000 megawatts of capacity again
this is a massive global leader in the
renewable space
on this next slide we can see that their
dividend has grown at a six percent
compounded annual growth rate
since 2000 as well their dividend has
not grown
nearly as much as $td bank over the years
but i mean this is still
great growth to the dividend and i also
think that $brookfield renewables share
price is going to grow more rapidly than
$td bank
over the coming years as well just with
all of the tailwinds that i think the
renewable sector is going to see in the
coming decades but regardless i do love
to see that $brookfield renewables is
actively and consistently raising their
dividend as well
year over year over year it's great to
see the next thing that i want to point
out is that for the year ended 2020
they reported a 924 million dollars of
ffo
and for those of you who may not know
ffo is essentially just free cash flow
for utilities and a reits or real estate
companies
for utility companies and reits you can
think of ffo as basically just free cash
flow so once again $brookfield renewables
reported 924 million dollars of free
cash flow
for the year ended 2020. now why this is
so attractive is because the market
capitalization of $brookfield on the
stock market today
is 10.71 billion dollars if we quickly
pull out a calculator we can enter in
their market valuation
and just divide it by the amount of free
cash flow that they produced in 2020
which was 924 million dollars
this right here tells me that $brookfield
renewable partners is selling for a
price to free cash flow of 11.59 right
now which i think is a very
reasonable valuation for a company
exposed to the renewable energy industry
and is a global leader in it
again keep in mind that it also offers
that three percent dividend yield so i
think that $brookfield renewable partners
is approaching
a very attractive valuation territory
the next thing i want to point out is
where analysts expect to see $brookfield
renewables within the next 12 months
here we can see that on the high end
analysts are expecting the stock to hit
about 52 dollars and 13 cents a share
and on the low end they're expecting
about 33 dollars a share
on average analysts are expecting the
stock to hit about 45 dollars and 16
cents a share within the next 12 months
which presents about a 6.86 percent
upside from where the stock is currently
today
so analysts do seem pretty bullish on
the next 12 months for this company as
well
and i kind of have to agree i mean i
believe that the world is still moving
towards renewable energy
and i think that the sell-off that this
stock has seen has been a little bit
overdone
i mean $brookfield renewable has major
deals with companies like $jp morgan
to make their offices 100 rely on
renewable energy that $brookfield
renewables is going to supply
this is a legit business and i do think
that the shift towards clean energy over
the next few decades
is still coming and ultimately at the
end of the day i think that $brookfield
renewables is one of the best stocks to
gain exposure to
all of the growth that the renewable
energy sector is going to see over the
next
decades i personally plan on holding the
stock for
pretty much ever collecting these
dividends and allowing it to grow
with the overall renewable industry all
right but now let's move on to the third
stock that i want to talk about and i'm
sure that this is going to surprise no
one
this stock is $truly cannabis this is
officially the largest stock in my
portfolio
and i am so bullish on the future of
this business
i have been adding to my position pretty
much whenever i can
because like every single time this
stock drops the valuation just gets more
and more attractive
and the risk associated with owning the
stock becomes less
and less so let's just dive right into
some of the basic fundamentals that i've
talked about on my channel just in case
some of you are new here
what i want to show you all is just how
much this company's revenue has been
growing
in 2016 they produced only 161 000
in revenue and in 2019 they finished the
year with 252
million dollars in revenue now if we
also take a look at the quarterly
earnings we can see that for the fourth
quarter of 2019
they reported 79.69 million dollars in
revenue and for the third quarter of
2020
they posted 136 million now for the
fourth quarter of 2020 i do believe that
they are going to be in the 170 million
dollar range
for reported revenue in just one quarter
so i think that when they report their
fourth quarter financials
we're only going to see this company's
revenue and earnings continue growing
rapidly for those of you who may not
know $true leave is like
the leader in the florida cannabis
market right now they are absolutely
dominating it this right here is
actually a report on the weekly cannabis
sales for florida right away we can see
that for the week ended february 25th
truly had 77 dispensaries open in the
state of florida
and the next company in line is $certaira
wellness with only 39 dispensary
locations
however check this out $true leave in
just one week
sold over 100 000 grams of medical
cannabis
the next competitor in line sold 20 000
grams of medical cannabis
so $true leave is absolutely dominating
the florida market right now
and this was also the first week in true
leaves history where they sold over 100
000 grams of cannabis
in just seven days so again this company
is experiencing
massive amounts of growth right now and
they own over 50 percent of the total
florida cannabis market
now why this is an important fact to
point out is because the florida
cannabis market is projected to
absolutely explode over the next five
years from 2019 to 2025 the florida
cannabis market is projected to grow
with a 40
compounded annual growth rate and
remember $true leave currently owns over
50 percent of the florida market
here we can see that sometime in 2022 or
2023
the adult or recreational market is
expected to open up in florida
and this is projected to explode the
cannabis sales in that one state
alone so if the florida market can in
fact hit five
billion dollars in revenue by 2025 and
$true leave can maintain their 50
market share then they should be
bringing in 2.5 billion dollars in
revenue
from florida alone within the next four
years this
is incredible growth just from this one
state and i think that just based off
florida alone that truly's valuation
today is incredibly cheap now here's the
thing $true leaf is also trying to expand
outside of the florida market
currently they're trying to expand into
california pennsylvania connecticut west
virginia and massachusetts
and by the way i have no idea how to say
massachusetts i've i
i just don't know how to say it my brain
can't do it apparently but anyways the
fact that i want to point out here is
that $true leave
is focusing on expanding their business
outside of the florida market
and as more states in the us legalize
either medical or recreational cannabis
i think that $true leave is only going to
continue expanding into more and more
states
the growth potential for this business
is absolutely ridiculous like the growth
potential in florida alone
i think is amazing and again i think the
company is undervalued
relative to how much potential there is
in florida alone this is also why true
leave is the largest position in my
portfolio because
i just see them having such a clear
runway for growth
and the valuation i think today is not
reflecting the full potential of the
business
the next thing that i want to point out
is that $true leave is projecting to
finish the year of 2020
with 465 to 485 million dollars in
revenue
we can also see over here on the right
hand side that their ebitda margin
is currently 44 to 46 percent and
they're projecting 205 to 225 million
dollars of positive ebitda
this is a ridiculously profitable
company and i think that truly
has the highest ebitda margins out of
all of the major cannabis companies
in the us like honestly the team over
there is just doing a phenomenal job
with their finances with the way they're
expanding their cash flow
all of it this is just such a solid
business and if $true leave can maintain
these positive ebitda margins all the
way out until 2025
then there is a very real possibility
that $true leave could be doing over one
billion dollars in positive ebitda
within the next four years
however i do want to say that i have
been loading into $true leave quite
aggressively lately
and i do have quite a bit of cash on the
sidelines still i'm well over 20
cash right now but i just want to be a
little bit more conservative when i buy
into the stock next because again i've
been already buying in i've already been
increasing my average cost basis on this
position
so i want to see the stock drop a little
bit more
before i start buying it more
aggressively but if $true leaf does
continue excelling off and coming down
then i am just going to continue adding
to my position
i am so bullish on this company and i
think that it has a great
future i'm also very comfortable having
the stock be the number one position in
my portfolio
and i think that is going to produce
some awesome gains over the next five
years and
honestly i'm probably going to end up
holding it forever because i just think
that it's going to continue growing and
growing and growing for years to come
before we move on i also just quickly
want to show you all the analyst price
targets for $true leaf so here we can see
that for the high end
analysts have a price target of 107
canadian that is just ridiculous on the
low end for the next 12 months analysts
are expecting the low to be 52 dollars
and 13 cents canadian and the average is
75 dollars and 28 cents which represents
a 20.72
upside from where the stock is currently
selling today analysts are incredibly
bullish on the stock over the next year
and so am i
i actually agree with all these price
targets and i don't think that it's
unrealistic for $truly to be selling
at least near the 70 range within the
next 12 months
but all right let's move on to the
fourth stock that i want to talk about
and this is $canadian solar ticker symbol
seasick if we take a look at a one month
chart we can see that this stock has
just been getting
absolutely destroyed with the overall
renewable energy sector
sell-off it's now selling for under 40
dollars a share and i think that this is
just
ridiculously cheap i mean the company
now has a market valuation of 2.348
billion dollars with a price to earnings
ratio of 11.55
and again i still believe that the world
is going to be moving more towards
renewable energy
and i think that solar is going to play
a large role in our clean energy future
so the fact that this company has been
selling off so much i think doesn't make
a lot of sense in the long term
and again the market valuation is now
sitting at 2.348 billion
and check this out in their most recent
quarter they reported a 914
million dollars in revenue which means
that if this revenue figure can keep up
for a full year
then $canadian solar is bringing in about
3.6 billion dollars of revenue
annually and again the stock is selling
for 2.3 billion dollars so their price
to sales ratio
is well below one right now i do want to
let you all know that i have been adding
to this position on the way down
but i'm going to stop buying because the
reporting earnings quite soon on march
18
2021 and after they report earnings i am
going to reassess if i want to continue
buying if i just want to hold or
really just update my buy thesis on this
company but anyways $canadian solar is
one of the market leaders in the global
solar industry and they also just
recently completed one of the largest
solar plus storage projects in america
like this is a
beast company in the solar industry
going forward $canadian solar also wants
to switch up their business model a
little bit
by retaining ownership in some of the
massive solar projects that they end up
building
this will ultimately bring in nice and
consistent reoccurring revenue and cash
flow for the business which i think will
significantly help the valuation
long term i just think that this
business has so much potential to
capitalize on the global
shift to renewable energy and again
they're a global
leader in the solar sector if we quickly
take a look at analyst price targets for
this business we can see that for the
high end they are projecting a price of
seventy one dollars a share and on the
low end it is
forty eight dollars a share which is
still above where the stock is selling
today
on average analysts are projecting the
price to be somewhere around fifty seven
dollars and sixty seven cents
which is up about 32.82 percent from
where the stock is today
and again i would have to agree with
these analyst price targets i think that
$canadian solar is getting hit
ridiculously hard right now and the
valuation is just
so attractive at these levels relative
to where the company is going to go
and all of the tailwinds in the
renewable sector over the coming decades
$canadian solar is one of the top four
largest positions in my portfolio
i have been adding to it on these dips
and i will consider adding even more
aggressively after i see the earnings on
march 18th
also i do believe that i am going to be
making an earnings update video
for my patreon i don't think that that's
a video that i want to make for the
public channel just because like it's
