today's video we'll be talking about
$beam therapeutics ticker symbol $b-e-a-m
and comparing them to $crispr
therapeutics ticker symbol $c-r-s-p
they are both companies in the business
of designing gene editing systems
to correct underlying genetic disease
we'll talk about their technology
how it's similar and how it's different
we'll talk about the ceo
of beam we'll talk about their pipeline
and
much more on this channel we talk about
companies in the genomic space
healthcare sector biotech and much more
we've been talking about $bio
nanogenomics $bingo since they were
trading around two dollars talking about
$sensionics
when they were one dollar a census when
they were one dollar
as well we've also talked about a number
of other gene editing companies

$beam therapeutics a new class of
precision genetic
medicines beam is pioneering the use of
base editing
a potential new class of precision
genetic medicines with a vision
of providing lifelong cures to patients
suffering from serious diseases
the dna is the underlying blueprint that
codes for the proteins which are the
functional units of
the body and they perform the tasks that
are required
to live and function however if you have
an abnormal
dna blueprint then you will create an
abnormal protein
and therefore have some type of genetic
disease
currently there are no cures for many
genetic diseases
because we haven't had a way to actually
correct the underlying blueprint
or the dna we've been waiting till the
proteins are created
they perform their abnormal function and
then we try and target
those proteins as best we can with
various therapeutics
in order to understand how a base editor
works which is what $beam therapeutics
has created
compared to $crispr cast 9's system of
gene editing you have to have a basic
understanding of what dna
is and the different parts associated
with it
dna is actually your blueprint and it is
created
out of four letters the first of which
is a the second is c
g and t as you can see here on the left
the letter t will always pair with a and
g will always pair with c
and if you move from left to right you
can see a sequence of different
letters and those letters are
instructions for the creation of a given
protein
number of diseases are caused by
an abnormal letter within a sequence so
if you substitute an
a for a c it will change the word
for example if you had the word the boy
jumps if you remove
one of the letters for example o in boy
and you replace it with a y
the sentence will not make much sense
and so if you remove
a t and you replace it with a c you're
going to get an
abnormally shapen protein in some
instances
this is where $beam therapeutics
technology comes
in they describe it as a pencil with an
eraser for example if you're at this dna
sequence
where you have the letter t if this t is
incorrect
they can actually go in with their base
editor
remove just the t and correct it to
a c for example and then they would be
able to also correct the letter a
and replace it with a g without
disrupting the rest of the dna sequence
now if we compare $beam therapeutics base
editor system
which is like a pencil and eraser where
you can just erase the letter t
and replace it with the correct letter
you can't do that with the $crispr
cast 9 system which $crispr therapeutics
uses
for their gene editing system they
actually use what's known as a barcode
and scissors method
so rather than being able to snip out a
single letter for example the letter
a you actually have to cut out a segment
of a number of nucleotides so you might
have to cut out c
a t a t g all in one
cut that segment out using the scissors
of the $crisper cast 9 system and then
replace it with new
dna the problem that occurs when you're
using the $crisper cast 9
barcode scissor system is that when you
cut out
larger segments of these nucleotides or
letters
when the dna goes back to repair itself
it has the potential to introduce errors
or add
incorrect letters to the mix and that
can disrupt the whole sequence
and that may not be a problem if you're
trying to knock out an abnormal
gene then that wouldn't be a problem but
if you're just trying to correct a
single letter it would be more efficient
and appropriate to potentially use the
beam system
to correct that single nucleotide
because it avoids the risk
of introducing insertions or deletions
that are
incorrect to get a better understanding
of what i mean let's actually take a
look at how the $crispr cast 9 system
uses their barcode scissor system to cut
at the dna
the $crispr cas9 gene editing process
begins when the complex recognizes and
binds to a short segment of dna
adjacent to the target site this
initiates
unwinding of the dna helix which allows
the guide rna to pair with a specific
target sequence in the dna
so the $crispr cast 9 system which $crispr
therapeutics uses is described in this
video
the cast 9 is the scissors that cuts at
this double stranded
helix or the double-stranded dna and
it's directed to
a given location within the dna which is
defective
by using the $crispr system
if the sequences pair precisely cas9
cuts the dna
forming a double strand break our cells
respond to such breaks by activating
natural dna repair pathways
those double-stranded breaks can
introduce errors into that genetic
sequence in some cases a process called
non-homologous end joining
results in the additional deletion of a
few base pairs
which disrupts the original dna sequence
and can cause gene inactivation
a larger fragment of dna can also be
removed by using
two different guide rnas to target
separate sites on either side of the
desired deletion
cleavage occurs at each site and the
repair process joins the separate
ends thereby deleting the intervening
sequence
[Applause]
correction so as you can see in order to
remove
or delete certain areas of the genome
you actually have to cut out larger
segments and be a little bit more
creative using the $crispr cast 9 system
compare that with beams base editing
system you can actually
cut out a single nucleotide at a time
and so it's more efficient and less
error prone
to dna can also be made by adding a dna
template
along with a cas9 guide rna complex
the template is designed with sequences
that exactly match the dna adjacent to
the target cut
site through a process called homology
directed repair
the cell uses the template to repair the
break thereby replacing the faulty dna
sequence
or even inserting a new gene
that's how $crispr cast 9 system uses
their technology to replace defective
dna they have to bring in a homologous
sequence of dna to actually fit into the
area that's been
cut out using their barcode scissor
system as they describe it
let's take a look at the advantages to
base editing compared to $crispr cast 9
which we just
looked at first of which the creation of
precise
predictable and efficient genetic
outcomes at a targeted sequence
number two high efficiency editing
without need for template based homology
directed repair
they don't have to bring in an extra
sequence of
dna to correctly edit a segment that's
been cut
is what they're describing here and
three avoidance of the unwanted
consequence of double stranded dna
breaks so anytime you cut dna
as we saw in that $crispr cast 9 video
there is the possibility
of inserting incorrect fragments of dna
such as frequent insertions and
deletions or larger scale genomic
rearrangements should mention
that after listening to the ceo dr cole
carney
from $crispr therapeutics they have
stated that their technology is very
safe
and they haven't had any issues with off
target
cuts before we move on we should talk
about dr david liu phd who
is the founder of this technology as
well as the company $beam therapeutics
and editos he is a richard merkin
professor and vice chair of faculty at
the broad institute of harvard and mit
professor of chemistry and chemical
biology at harvard university
and howard hughes medical institute
investigator
he has published more than 150 papers
and is an inventor of more than 50
issued patents i took a look a lot of
his publications
are in nature which is one of the most
prestigious journals
in all of scientific literature his work
on base editing has spurred numerous
publications within the healthcare
field publications have already come out
describing the base editing system
to be effective in treating diseases in
animal models for dr
lou is actually quite prolific within
the field of gene editing
and some have said that base editing is
an evolution
from $crispr cast 9 and may be a better
more efficient system as we have
described taking a look at their
pipeline they are working towards
curative
disease pathways for sickle cell anemia
beta thalassemia
as well as looking in immuno-oncology
disease such as t cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia
they're also trying to treat rare
diseases alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency
glycogen storage disorder 1a and are
also looking
into the treatment of ocular disease
ocular disease has been the focus of the
company editos
and hematologic conditions have been the
focus of $crispr therapeutics
as well as intelia $beam therapeutics is
much earlier
in their clinical work than $crispr
therapeutics $crispr therapeutics
has already conducted phase 1 phase ii
clinical work
in the treatment of sickle cell anemias
actually published their work
in new england journal of medicine
whereas this company is trying to treat
sickle cell
disease using their base editing system
but they are currently only
in the ind enabling period that is when
you submit an application
to the fda to gain approval to actually
begin clinical work
again this company was founded in 2017
compared to $crispr therapeutics which
was founded in 2013
currently $beam therapeutics is trading
at about half the market cap
of $crispr therapeutics $crispr
therapeutics they've already published
data
regarding sickle cell anemia as well as
beta thalassemia
and those results have been quite
positive also dr cole carney
has described their work in
immuno-oncology and they believe that
they haven't had issues with off-target
cuts
or some of the issues that could arise
from their barcode scissor system
compared to the base editing system by
$beam therapeutics
it appears that $beam therapeutics base
editing system could be an evolution
and improvement on the current barcode
scissor system
that $crispr therapeutics intelia and
editos use
however as you can see from their
pipeline they are much
earlier i have a position in both beam
therapeutics as well as
$crispr therapeutics this is not medical
or financial advice
please do your own due diligence and
happy investing
