we are living in a weird world right now
what do you do with all this money that
the government keeps
throwing at us stimulus checks stimmy
checks keep coming at us
we get infrastructure bill news 2.3
trillion with the t dollars the
government
just keeps printing money cash
is trash right now inflation
is going to be coming towards the end of
2021
early 2022 we're going to see those
inflation numbers start to creep up
that is bad for the stock market right
wrong
not necessarily sure some sectors are
going to get absolutely demolished
while all this cash that's being printed
is gonna flood
into other sectors and that's what we're
gonna be talking about
in today's video what stocks are good
deals today
even though the stock market is trading
at these unprecedented levels
all-time highs there are still some
really good deals out there
for long-term buys and that's what we're
going to be breaking down today
some stocks that are good deals today
and are going to be even better deals
tomorrow

is a good deal

inflation is coming that's what we're
going to be talking about today what
inflation is how it's going to affect
the stock market
and what sectors what specific stocks
should we be putting this money in to
avoid
the inflation crash that everybody's
talking about
so inflation the year is 2021
you have 10 dollars you grow go to the
grocery store
and with that ten dollars you can get
two gallons of milk
a year goes by inflation is on the rise
you go to the same grocery store now
it's
you still have 10 bucks but you can only
get
one gallon of milk why does inflation
happen
because the government continues to
print money
they keep throwing stemi checks at us
they're printing money for this bill
that's all over the news in the media
that is why inflation happens it weakens
the us
dollar people say investors say it's a
bad thing
and sure it is not good inflation's
never good
but we can look at sectors that are
going to benefit
from inflation we also need to be
cognizant
of hedge funds that have been using
margin left and right they've been
loading the boat up
over the last 12 months or so with
margin aka
borrowing money loaning money to invest
in the stock market
this $discovery stock is a huge example
of what can happen
when these hedge funds start flooding
the market trying to reduce some of
their margin
a big hedge fund got a margin call they
owned
$discovery stock and this is what
happened okay so this was the hedge fund
buying in creating a squeeze and it ran
$discovery stock
all the way up from 25 less than 25
dollars a share
up to almost 80 a share their broker
said wait a second you are way too
leveraged you have
way too much margin on your books that's
too much
too much risk for us to take on so we're
going to liquidate you
we're going to sell all your stocks and
this is what happened
and $discovery stock crashed also $cbs
viacom
crashed as well and that was all due to
margin nothing
changed from a fundamental perspective
so i think we could see more of this
start to happen
as these big hedge funds start to
realize that they're too leveraged
they have too much margin out there and
they need to scale it back
as the market continues to go higher the
$s p
500 all-time highs the nasdaq has
bounced back
the dow jones has bounced back so what's
next
are these hedge funds gonna flood the
market and cause a crash
well maybe maybe in some sectors but
there's some sectors that are gonna
benefit
from this inflation this money that's
getting printed left and right
we have cash on deck everybody has cash
because the government has been throwing
it at us and
people are going to be investing it in
the stock market they're going to be
looking for good deals
and what are the best deals out there
it's not the recovery stocks look at
stocks like $delta airlines
right $delta airlines is trading higher
than it was pre-rona look at this
pre-rona we are trading at 57 or 60
a share so we're not exactly trading
higher than pre-rona
but we should not be trading at this
anywhere near the same levels
as we were pre-rona yet we are this is a
weekly chart
and we are trading at the same levels as
we were
in 2019 2018
even though $delta's numbers are much
worse
similar to um look at $boeing $boeing
is making a nice steady climb higher and
i'm not saying $boeing's not a good
long-term investment
but it is up from 90 a share back to 275
since the roano lows and that is not the
best deal the best deals
are the ones that have been getting
crushed lately and that is ev
eevee has got slaughtered of late
but as investors look for places to put
their money
to avoid inflation they are going to be
looking
at growth sectors such as eevee and tech
which have been hurt the worst over the
last month or so
welcome to national stock a graphic
we see $xl stock hiding in this cave
hibernating
over the last month $xl stock has been
hibernating but today it smelled
some blueberries spring is coming and
excel stock
woke up $xl stock is one of the most
undervalued stocks than the entire
market it continues to crash
why does it continue to crash because
retail traders
caused a squeeze this was hype this was
fomo
and up here short sellers stepped in and
they started to manipulate the market
what did they do they said this is weak
hands this is retail traders
who bought who aren't going to be able
to withstand us if we come in
manipulate the market and short this
stock that's exactly what they did
everybody panicked out of their position
and this thing
crashed today we got news that they got
an order for 19 vehicles
and the stock was up 20 at the highs
but 19 vehicles isn't going to cut it we
can see the spike
early in the morning followed by a crash
19 vehicles isn't changing anything
however it's a good start and i do think
we're gonna start to see more and more
deals
of this nature come into excel fleet
it's a steal at eight dollars and fifty
cents where it's at today
and i think this stock is trading at 25
30 within the next 12 to 24 months
so if you're looking for a place to put
your money to avoid inflation
$xl stock is a good place in my opinion
some investors aren't big on hybrid and
i'm the exact opposite i think hybrid is
gonna be the bridge
to get us to total ev i've said it a
thousand times and i will say it a
thousand more times we are not
ready for total ev in these big
fleets right if you are a construction
crew
do you want to go from diesel or gas to
total ev
right now no way the technology isn't
there yet the range
the power the torque the towing capacity
it's not there yet but hybrid it is
there so $xl fleet i think has an
edge and eventually they will need to
transition to total ev
but hybrid is going to get us across
that bridge and
you usps deal the usps contract
is justification and backs that thesis
up
everybody thought the usps deal was
going to go to $workhorse
and their total ev solution and
everybody was wrong
why because total ev it's not there
yet it will be maybe five six seven
years down the road
but not today and companies like excel
fleet are going to benefit
from this transition $blink charging
$blink charging is another stock that i'm
putting my money into
to avoid inflation or combat inflation
because you can't
avoid inflation we can combat it and try
to beat it
we can't avoid it but we can beat it we
can outpace it
so $blink charging this is kind of an
infrastructure deal right
infrastructure deal is going to cause
inflation
but we can look and see where is that
money going to and we can be
there before the money gets there right
we can be waiting
waiting on that infrastructure money to
come in and then
ride the wave higher beating the
inflation
so $blink charging this is where the
infrastructure
deal was announced all we got was about
a seven or eight percent
jump from the announcement so i think
there is a lot of room
left to go right there's no way we
should not be trading at all-time highs
we're gonna have a hundred and seventy
five billion dollars going into this
sector
with more than five hundred thousand new
ev charging stations
coming out into the u.s network because
of this infrastructure bill
so there's no way $blink charging should
not be trading at all-time highs
we're trading at forty dollars right now
we have all-time highs of sixty-four
dollars
i think over the next three to five
months and especially if the
infrastructure bill gets passed
this thing is a seventy dollar stock
before the end of the
year and i know i keep talking about
$blink charging i'm sure you guys are
tired of it
but i cannot emphasize enough that this
is one of my highest conviction stocks
right now $palantir $palantir the james
bond
of the stock market one of the highest
tech most innovative disruptive
companies to come into the market in a
long time
it keeps dropping it hasn't made that
move that we've been looking for
but this is one of those stocks that
will benefit as investors flood money
into the stock market
and we're getting it at an unbelievable
deal right now this is one of those
companies that is going to be growing
over the next decade we're going to see
huge growth they just landed
a big 90 million dollar contract
with the government a really big deal
$planeteer jumped only five or six
percent
after announcing a 89 million order from
the national nuclear
security administration they keep
getting government deals
this cyber security firm keeps getting
government deals
and their average customer spend is huge
i think the average customer is spending
around 10 million dollars
annually with $planteer so you can
imagine
it's a snowball effect every customer
you add
that's spending 10 15 million dollars
annually with you
on a reoccurring basis it starts to
build
it starts to snowball and before you
know it they're going to be doing
a few billion dollars annually in
revenue and this stock
is just too cheap based on its expected
and projected revenue growth over the
next few years
even though these deals keep getting
announced $planeteer is still trading
way off these all-time highs of 45
dollars a share
100 upside potential to those recent
highs
i think investors are gonna see the
revenue growth coming in and flock to
the stock
i'm going to be waiting i'm already
buying i bought some last week i'm
looking to add on any
more pullbacks so we'll be continuing to
watch
this $palantir as i think it's one of the
best growth
stocks to buy right now data
is the new currency these companies are
spending tons of money
to collect data on their customers you
may not like it
you may not want your data out there
floating around
and these companies to have your data
but it's happening
and they're going to do everything to
protect it because if
a company's data is breached if there is
a security breach
and your data is stolen from these
companies you are less likely to want to
do business
with these companies and that's what
$palantir does they help protect
data from security breaches and this
industry is growing
$palantir is growing and i believe it's a
really good deer deal here at 22
